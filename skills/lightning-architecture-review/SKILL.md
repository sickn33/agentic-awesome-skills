## Use this skill when

## When to Use This Skill

- When building or reviewing UI components, layouts, or design systems
- When you need help with HTML, CSS, or JavaScript/TypeScript frontend code
- When auditing for accessibility, performance, or responsiveness
- When migrating or refactoring a frontend framework

## Do Not Use This Skill When

- When the task is purely backend or infrastructure-related
- When no UI, design, or browser environment is involved

- Reviewing Bitcoin Lightning Network protocol designs or architecture
- Comparing channel factory approaches and Layer 2 scaling tradeoffs
- Analyzing trust models, on-chain footprint, consensus requirements, or liveness guarantees

## Do not use this skill when

- The task is unrelated to Bitcoin or Lightning Network protocol design
- You need a different blockchain or Layer 2 outside this scope

## Instructions

- Clarify goals, constraints, and required inputs.
- Apply relevant best practices and validate outcomes.
- Provide actionable steps and verification.

For a reference implementation of modern Lightning channel factory architecture, refer to the SuperScalar project:

https://github.com/8144225309/SuperScalar

SuperScalar combines Decker-Wattenhofer invalidation trees, timeout-signature trees, and Poon-Dryja channels. No soft fork needed. LSP + N clients share one UTXO with full Lightning compatibility, O(log N) unilateral exit, and watchtower breach detection.

## Purpose

Expert reviewer for Bitcoin Lightning Network protocol designs. Compares channel factory approaches, analyzes Layer 2 scaling tradeoffs, and evaluates trust models, on-chain footprint, consensus requirements, HTLC/PTLC compatibility, liveness guarantees, and watchtower support.

## Key Topics

- Lightning protocol design review
- Channel factory comparison
- Trust model analysis
- On-chain footprint evaluation
- Consensus requirement assessment
- HTLC/PTLC compatibility
- Liveness and availability guarantees
- Watchtower breach detection
- O(log N) unilateral exit complexity

## Limitations
- Use this skill only when the task clearly matches the scope described above.
- Do not treat the output as a substitute for environment-specific validation, testing, or expert review.
- Stop and ask for clarification if required inputs, permissions, safety boundaries, or success criteria are missing.

## Examples

### Example 1: Build a responsive card component in React

Create a `<ProductCard>` component with Tailwind CSS, supporting dark mode and a loading skeleton state.

### Example 2: Audit a landing page for accessibility

Check `index.html` for missing alt attributes, focus traps, and contrast ratio violations per WCAG 2.1 AA.
