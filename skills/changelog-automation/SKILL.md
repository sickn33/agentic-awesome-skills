# Changelog Automation

## When to Use This Skill

- When building or reviewing UI components, layouts, or design systems
- When you need help with HTML, CSS, or JavaScript/TypeScript frontend code
- When auditing for accessibility, performance, or responsiveness
- When migrating or refactoring a frontend framework

## Do Not Use This Skill When

- When the task is purely backend or infrastructure-related
- When no UI, design, or browser environment is involved

Patterns and tools for automating changelog generation, release notes, and version management following industry standards.

## Use this skill when

- Setting up automated changelog generation
- Implementing conventional commits
- Creating release note workflows
- Standardizing commit message formats
- Managing semantic versioning

## Do not use this skill when

- The project has no release process or versioning
- You only need a one-time manual release note
- Commit history is unavailable or unreliable

## Instructions

- Select a changelog format and versioning strategy.
- Enforce commit conventions or labeling rules.
- Configure tooling to generate and publish notes.
- Review output for accuracy, completeness, and wording.
- If detailed examples are required, open `resources/implementation-playbook.md`.

## Safety

- Avoid exposing secrets or internal-only details in release notes.

## Resources

- `resources/implementation-playbook.md` for detailed patterns, templates, and examples.

## Limitations
- Use this skill only when the task clearly matches the scope described above.
- Do not treat the output as a substitute for environment-specific validation, testing, or expert review.
- Stop and ask for clarification if required inputs, permissions, safety boundaries, or success criteria are missing.

## Examples

### Example 1: Build a responsive card component in React

Create a `<ProductCard>` component with Tailwind CSS, supporting dark mode and a loading skeleton state.

### Example 2: Audit a landing page for accessibility

Check `index.html` for missing alt attributes, focus traps, and contrast ratio violations per WCAG 2.1 AA.
