# Test Fixing

Systematically identify and fix all failing tests using smart grouping strategies.

## When to Use
- Explicitly asks to fix tests ("fix these tests", "make tests pass")
- Reports test failures ("tests are failing", "test suite is broken")
- Completes implementation and wants tests passing
- Mentions CI/CD failures due to tests

## Systematic Approach

### 1. Initial Test Run

Read project instructions, dependency manifests and CI configuration to identify the existing test command. Use `make test` only if that target exists and is the project contract. Inspect fixture/service requirements before running it; do not invoke production operations to obtain a baseline. Preserve pre-existing changes.

Analyze output for:

- Total number of failures
- Error types and patterns
- Affected modules/files

### 2. Smart Error Grouping

Group similar failures by:

- **Error type**: ImportError, AttributeError, AssertionError, etc.
- **Module/file**: Same file causing multiple test failure
- **Root cause**: Missing dependencies, API changes, refactoring impacts

Prioritize groups by:

- Number of affected tests (highest impact first)
- Dependency order (fix infrastructure before functionality)

### 3. Systematic Fixing Process

For each group (starting with highest impact):

1. **Identify root cause**

   - Read relevant code
   - Check recent changes with `git diff`
   - Understand the error pattern

2. **Implement fix**

   - Use the host's available file-editing tool for code changes
   - Follow applicable project instructions and conventions
   - Make minimal, focused changes

3. **Verify fix**

   - Run subset of tests for this group
   - Use pytest markers or file patterns:
     ```bash
     uv run pytest tests/path/to/test_file.py -v
     uv run pytest -k "pattern" -v
     ```
   - Ensure group passes before moving on

4. **Move to next group**

### 4. Fix Order Strategy

**Infrastructure first:**

- Import errors
- Missing dependencies
- Configuration issues

**Then API changes:**

- Function signature changes
- Module reorganization
- Renamed variables/functions

**Finally, logic issues:**

- Assertion failures
- Business logic bugs
- Edge case handling

### 5. Final Verification

After all groups fixed:

- Run the project's verified complete test command
- Verify no regressions
- Check test coverage remains intact

## Best Practices

- Fix one group at a time
- Run focused tests after each fix
- Use `git diff` to understand recent changes
- Look for patterns in failures
- Don't move to next group until current passes
- Keep changes minimal and focused
- Do not delete assertions, skip failing cases, lower coverage thresholds or change expected behavior merely to obtain green tests. A test update requires evidence that the product contract changed. Report unavailable dependencies, flaky failures and unexecuted checks explicitly.

## Example Workflow

User: "The tests are failing after my refactor"

1. In a repository with a verified `make test` target, run it → 15 failures identified
2. Group errors:
   - 8 ImportErrors (module renamed)
   - 5 AttributeErrors (function signature changed)
   - 2 AssertionErrors (logic bugs)
3. Fix ImportErrors first → Run subset → Verify
4. Fix AttributeErrors → Run subset → Verify
5. Fix AssertionErrors → Run subset → Verify
6. Run full suite → All pass ✓

## Limitations
- Use this skill only when the task clearly matches the scope described above.
- Do not treat the output as a substitute for environment-specific validation, testing, or expert review.
- Stop and ask for clarification if required inputs, permissions, safety boundaries, or success criteria are missing.
