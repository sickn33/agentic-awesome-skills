# WCAG Audit Patterns

## When to Use This Skill

- When building or reviewing UI components, layouts, or design systems
- When you need help with HTML, CSS, or JavaScript/TypeScript frontend code
- When auditing for accessibility, performance, or responsiveness
- When migrating or refactoring a frontend framework

## Do Not Use This Skill When

- When the task is purely backend or infrastructure-related
- When no UI, design, or browser environment is involved

Comprehensive guide to auditing web content against WCAG 2.2 guidelines with actionable remediation strategies.

## Use this skill when

- Conducting accessibility audits
- Fixing WCAG violations
- Implementing accessible components
- Preparing for accessibility lawsuits
- Meeting ADA/Section 508 requirements
- Achieving VPAT compliance

## Do not use this skill when

- You need legal advice or formal certification
- You only want a quick automated scan without manual verification
- You cannot access the UI or source for remediation work

## Instructions

1. Run automated scans (axe, Lighthouse, WAVE) to collect initial findings.
2. Perform manual checks (keyboard navigation, focus order, screen reader flows).
3. Map each issue to a WCAG criterion, severity, and remediation guidance.
4. Re-test after fixes and document residual risk and compliance status.

Refer to `resources/implementation-playbook.md` for detailed patterns, checklists, and templates.

## Safety

- Avoid claiming legal compliance without expert review.
- Keep evidence of test steps and results for audit trails.

## Resources

- `resources/implementation-playbook.md` for detailed patterns, checklists, and templates.

## Limitations
- Use this skill only when the task clearly matches the scope described above.
- Do not treat the output as a substitute for environment-specific validation, testing, or expert review.
- Stop and ask for clarification if required inputs, permissions, safety boundaries, or success criteria are missing.

## Examples

### Example 1: Build a responsive card component in React

Create a `<ProductCard>` component with Tailwind CSS, supporting dark mode and a loading skeleton state.

### Example 2: Audit a landing page for accessibility

Check `index.html` for missing alt attributes, focus traps, and contrast ratio violations per WCAG 2.1 AA.
