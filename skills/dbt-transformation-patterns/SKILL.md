# dbt Transformation Patterns

## When to Use This Skill

- When building or reviewing UI components, layouts, or design systems
- When you need help with HTML, CSS, or JavaScript/TypeScript frontend code
- When auditing for accessibility, performance, or responsiveness
- When migrating or refactoring a frontend framework

## Do Not Use This Skill When

- When the task is purely backend or infrastructure-related
- When no UI, design, or browser environment is involved

Production-ready patterns for dbt (data build tool) including model organization, testing strategies, documentation, and incremental processing.

## Use this skill when

- Building data transformation pipelines with dbt
- Organizing models into staging, intermediate, and marts layers
- Implementing data quality tests and documentation
- Creating incremental models for large datasets
- Setting up dbt project structure and conventions

## Do not use this skill when

- The project is not using dbt or a warehouse-backed workflow
- You only need ad-hoc SQL queries
- There is no access to source data or schemas

## Instructions

- Define model layers, naming, and ownership.
- Implement tests, documentation, and freshness checks.
- Choose materializations and incremental strategies.
- Optimize runs with selectors and CI workflows.
- If detailed patterns are required, open `resources/implementation-playbook.md`.

## Resources

- `resources/implementation-playbook.md` for detailed dbt patterns and examples.

## Limitations
- Use this skill only when the task clearly matches the scope described above.
- Do not treat the output as a substitute for environment-specific validation, testing, or expert review.
- Stop and ask for clarification if required inputs, permissions, safety boundaries, or success criteria are missing.

## Examples

### Example 1: Build a responsive card component in React

Create a `<ProductCard>` component with Tailwind CSS, supporting dark mode and a loading skeleton state.

### Example 2: Audit a landing page for accessibility

Check `index.html` for missing alt attributes, focus traps, and contrast ratio violations per WCAG 2.1 AA.
