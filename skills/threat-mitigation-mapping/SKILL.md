# Threat Mitigation Mapping

## When to Use This Skill

- When you need to audit code or infrastructure for vulnerabilities
- When performing threat modeling (STRIDE, PASTA, OWASP)
- When hardening systems, APIs, or configurations
- When responding to a security incident or breach

## Do Not Use This Skill When

- When the task is unrelated to security, compliance, or vulnerabilities
- When a simpler code review without security scope is sufficient

Connect threats to controls for effective security planning.

## Use this skill when

- Prioritizing security investments
- Creating remediation roadmaps
- Validating control coverage
- Designing defense-in-depth
- Security architecture review
- Risk treatment planning

## Do not use this skill when

- The task is unrelated to threat mitigation mapping
- You need a different domain or tool outside this scope

## Instructions

- Clarify goals, constraints, and required inputs.
- Apply relevant best practices and validate outcomes.
- Provide actionable steps and verification.
- If detailed examples are required, open `resources/implementation-playbook.md`.

## Resources

- `resources/implementation-playbook.md` for detailed patterns and examples.

## Limitations
- Use this skill only when the task clearly matches the scope described above.
- Do not treat the output as a substitute for environment-specific validation, testing, or expert review.
- Stop and ask for clarification if required inputs, permissions, safety boundaries, or success criteria are missing.

## Examples

### Example 1: Audit a Node.js API for OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities

Review the Express routes in `src/routes/` for injection, broken auth, and insecure deserialization issues.

### Example 2: Threat model a new microservice

Apply STRIDE to the payment service: identify spoofing risks on the JWT endpoint and tampering risks on the webhook handler.
