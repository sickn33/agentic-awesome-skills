# Apache Airflow DAG Patterns

## When to Use This Skill

- When building or reviewing UI components, layouts, or design systems
- When you need help with HTML, CSS, or JavaScript/TypeScript frontend code
- When auditing for accessibility, performance, or responsiveness
- When migrating or refactoring a frontend framework

## Do Not Use This Skill When

- When the task is purely backend or infrastructure-related
- When no UI, design, or browser environment is involved

Production-ready patterns for Apache Airflow including DAG design, operators, sensors, testing, and deployment strategies.

## Use this skill when

- Creating data pipeline orchestration with Airflow
- Designing DAG structures and dependencies
- Implementing custom operators and sensors
- Testing Airflow DAGs locally
- Setting up Airflow in production
- Debugging failed DAG runs

## Do not use this skill when

- You only need a simple cron job or shell script
- Airflow is not part of the tooling stack
- The task is unrelated to workflow orchestration

## Instructions

1. Identify data sources, schedules, and dependencies.
2. Design idempotent tasks with clear ownership and retries.
3. Implement DAGs with observability and alerting hooks.
4. Validate in staging and document operational runbooks.

Refer to `resources/implementation-playbook.md` for detailed patterns, checklists, and templates.

## Safety

- Avoid changing production DAG schedules without approval.
- Test backfills and retries carefully to prevent data duplication.

## Resources

- `resources/implementation-playbook.md` for detailed patterns, checklists, and templates.

## Limitations
- Use this skill only when the task clearly matches the scope described above.
- Do not treat the output as a substitute for environment-specific validation, testing, or expert review.
- Stop and ask for clarification if required inputs, permissions, safety boundaries, or success criteria are missing.

## Examples

### Example 1: Build a responsive card component in React

Create a `<ProductCard>` component with Tailwind CSS, supporting dark mode and a loading skeleton state.

### Example 2: Audit a landing page for accessibility

Check `index.html` for missing alt attributes, focus traps, and contrast ratio violations per WCAG 2.1 AA.
