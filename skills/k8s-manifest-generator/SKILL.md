# Kubernetes Manifest Generator

## When to Use This Skill

- When you need to audit code or infrastructure for vulnerabilities
- When performing threat modeling (STRIDE, PASTA, OWASP)
- When hardening systems, APIs, or configurations
- When responding to a security incident or breach

## Do Not Use This Skill When

- When the task is unrelated to security, compliance, or vulnerabilities
- When a simpler code review without security scope is sufficient

Step-by-step guidance for creating production-ready Kubernetes manifests including Deployments, Services, ConfigMaps, Secrets, and PersistentVolumeClaims.

## Use this skill when

Use this skill when you need to:
- Create new Kubernetes Deployment manifests
- Define Service resources for network connectivity
- Generate ConfigMap and Secret resources for configuration management
- Create PersistentVolumeClaim manifests for stateful workloads
- Follow Kubernetes best practices and naming conventions
- Implement resource limits, health checks, and security contexts
- Design manifests for multi-environment deployments

## Do not use this skill when

- The task is unrelated to kubernetes manifest generator
- You need a different domain or tool outside this scope

## Instructions

- Clarify goals, constraints, and required inputs.
- Apply relevant best practices and validate outcomes.
- Provide actionable steps and verification.
- If detailed examples are required, open `resources/implementation-playbook.md`.

## Resources

- `resources/implementation-playbook.md` for detailed patterns and examples.

## Limitations
- Use this skill only when the task clearly matches the scope described above.
- Do not treat the output as a substitute for environment-specific validation, testing, or expert review.
- Stop and ask for clarification if required inputs, permissions, safety boundaries, or success criteria are missing.

## Examples

### Example 1: Audit a Node.js API for OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities

Review the Express routes in `src/routes/` for injection, broken auth, and insecure deserialization issues.

### Example 2: Threat model a new microservice

Apply STRIDE to the payment service: identify spoofing risks on the JWT endpoint and tampering risks on the webhook handler.
