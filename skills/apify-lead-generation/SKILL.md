# Lead Generation

Scrape leads from multiple platforms using Apify Actors.

## When to Use
- You need business, creator, or contact leads from maps, search, social, or video platforms.
- The task involves selecting an Apify Actor to discover prospects and extract outreach data.
- You need exported lead data plus a concise summary of lead quality or segmentation.

## Prerequisites
Verify prerequisites before any paid run.

- `.env` file with `APIFY_TOKEN`
- Node.js 20.6+ (for native `--env-file` support)
- An approved Apify connector or Console access to inspect the chosen Actor and its schema; the bundled runner uses REST directly.
- Keep `.env` untracked and private; configure the token locally without pasting it into chat or command arguments.

## Workflow

Copy this checklist and track progress:

```
Task Progress:
- [ ] Step 1: Determine lead source (select Actor)
- [ ] Step 2: Fetch Actor schema via an approved connector or Console
- [ ] Step 3: Ask user preferences (format, filename)
- [ ] Step 4: Run the lead finder script
- [ ] Step 5: Summarize results
```

### Step 1: Determine Lead Source

Select the appropriate Actor based on user needs:

| User Need | Actor ID | Best For |
|-----------|----------|----------|
| Local businesses | `compass/crawler-google-places` | Restaurants, gyms, shops |
| Contact enrichment | `vdrmota/contact-info-scraper` | Emails, phones from URLs |
| Instagram profiles | `apify/instagram-profile-scraper` | Influencer discovery |
| Instagram posts/comments | `apify/instagram-scraper` | Posts, comments, hashtags, places |
| Instagram search | `apify/instagram-search-scraper` | Places, users, hashtags discovery |
| TikTok videos/hashtags | `clockworks/tiktok-scraper` | Comprehensive TikTok data extraction |
| TikTok hashtags/profiles | `clockworks/free-tiktok-scraper` | Free TikTok data extractor |
| TikTok user search | `clockworks/tiktok-user-search-scraper` | Find users by keywords |
| TikTok profiles | `clockworks/tiktok-profile-scraper` | Creator outreach |
| TikTok followers/following | `clockworks/tiktok-followers-scraper` | Audience analysis, segmentation |
| Facebook pages | `apify/facebook-pages-scraper` | Business contacts |
| Facebook page contacts | `apify/facebook-page-contact-information` | Extract emails, phones, addresses |
| Facebook groups | `apify/facebook-groups-scraper` | Buying intent signals |
| Facebook events | `apify/facebook-events-scraper` | Event networking, partnerships |
| Google Search | `apify/google-search-scraper` | Broad lead discovery |
| YouTube channels | `streamers/youtube-scraper` | Creator partnerships |
| Google Maps emails | `poidata/google-maps-email-extractor` | Direct email extraction |

### Step 2: Fetch Actor Schema

Inspect the current Actor details and input schema using the authenticated Apify connector available in the session, or its Console page. Discover actual tool names and parameters before calling them. Do not parse `.env` with shell substitution or pass a token as a CLI header argument. Treat the Actor table as discovery candidates, not verified availability or schemas.

This returns:
- Actor description and README
- Required and optional input parameters
- Output fields (if available)

### Step 3: Ask User Preferences

Before running, ask:
1. **Output format**:
   - **Quick answer** - Display top few results in chat (no file saved)
   - **CSV** - Bounded export, union of returned fields
   - **JSON** - Bounded export in JSON format
2. **Number of results**: Based on character of use case

### Step 4: Run the Script

**Quick answer (display in chat, no file):**
```bash
node --env-file=.env "<resolved-skill-directory>/reference/scripts/run_actor.js" \
  --actor "ACTOR_ID" \
  --input 'JSON_INPUT'
```

**CSV:**
```bash
node --env-file=.env "<resolved-skill-directory>/reference/scripts/run_actor.js" \
  --actor "ACTOR_ID" \
  --input 'JSON_INPUT' \
  --output YYYY-MM-DD_OUTPUT_FILE.csv \
  --format csv
```

**JSON:**
```bash
node --env-file=.env "<resolved-skill-directory>/reference/scripts/run_actor.js" \
  --actor "ACTOR_ID" \
  --input 'JSON_INPUT' \
  --output YYYY-MM-DD_OUTPUT_FILE.json \
  --format json
```

### Step 5: Summarize Results

After completion, report:
- Number of leads found
- File location and name
- Key fields available
- Suggested next steps (filtering, enrichment)

## Error Handling

`APIFY_TOKEN not found` - Ask user to create `.env` with `APIFY_TOKEN=your_token`
`Connector unavailable` - Inspect the schema through the Console; do not claim an unavailable tool was called.
`Actor not found` - Check Actor ID spelling
`Run FAILED` - Ask user to check Apify console link in error output
`Timeout` - The local timeout does not abort the remote run. Inspect the printed run ID in Console before retrying to avoid duplicate charges.

## Run Boundaries

Before launch, confirm the selected Actor, authorized public-data scope, current input schema, result limits and pricing with the user’s request. Respect source terms and access controls; do not collect private group data or unnecessary personal contact information. Start with a small Actor-supported input limit. `--max-items` limits downloaded output only (default 1000); it does not cap Actor work or billing. The helper sends a skill-identifying User-Agent to Apify. Resolve the installed skill directory in the command placeholders. Output files must be new paths; exports preserve long values and heterogeneous fields. Quick answers fetch at most five records; minimize or redact personal fields before sharing.

Only collect business contact fields needed for the authorized purpose. Public visibility does not establish outreach consent: preserve the source URL/date, suppress opt-outs and duplicates, and verify jurisdictional and platform restrictions before use. Do not infer sensitive personal traits from followers or group membership. Lead discovery does not authorize sending messages or uploading contacts to another service.

## Limitations
- Use this skill only when the task clearly matches the scope described above.
- Do not treat the output as a substitute for environment-specific validation, testing, or expert review.
- Stop and ask for clarification if required inputs, permissions, safety boundaries, or success criteria are missing.
