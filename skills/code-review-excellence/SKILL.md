# Code Review Excellence

## When to Use This Skill

- When you need to audit code or infrastructure for vulnerabilities
- When performing threat modeling (STRIDE, PASTA, OWASP)
- When hardening systems, APIs, or configurations
- When responding to a security incident or breach

## Do Not Use This Skill When

- When the task is unrelated to security, compliance, or vulnerabilities
- When a simpler code review without security scope is sufficient

Transform code reviews from gatekeeping to knowledge sharing through constructive feedback, systematic analysis, and collaborative improvement.

## Use this skill when

- Reviewing pull requests and code changes
- Establishing code review standards
- Mentoring developers through review feedback
- Auditing for correctness, security, or performance

## Do not use this skill when

- There are no code changes to review
- The task is a design-only discussion without code
- You need to implement fixes instead of reviewing

## Instructions

- Read context, requirements, and test signals first.
- Review for correctness, security, performance, and maintainability.
- Provide actionable feedback with severity and rationale.
- Ask clarifying questions when intent is unclear.
- If detailed checklists are required, open `resources/implementation-playbook.md`.

## Output Format

- High-level summary of findings
- Issues grouped by severity (blocking, important, minor)
- Suggestions and questions
- Test and coverage notes

## Resources

- `resources/implementation-playbook.md` for detailed review patterns and templates.

## Limitations
- Use this skill only when the task clearly matches the scope described above.
- Do not treat the output as a substitute for environment-specific validation, testing, or expert review.
- Stop and ask for clarification if required inputs, permissions, safety boundaries, or success criteria are missing.

## Examples

### Example 1: Audit a Node.js API for OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities

Review the Express routes in `src/routes/` for injection, broken auth, and insecure deserialization issues.

### Example 2: Threat model a new microservice

Apply STRIDE to the payment service: identify spoofing risks on the JWT endpoint and tampering risks on the webhook handler.
