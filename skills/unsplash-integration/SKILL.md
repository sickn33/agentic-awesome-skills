# Unsplash Integration Skill

[Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/) provides the world's largest open collection of high-quality photos, essential for elevating the visual tone of any project.

## Context

Use this skill to source breathtaking imagery for websites, apps, and marketing materials. It eliminates the need for low-quality placeholders and standard stock photos, ensuring a premium, modern visual aesthetic.

## When to Use
Trigger this skill when:

- Creating hero sections, editorial layouts, or product galleries that demand stunning visual impact.
- Sourcing specific artistic textures, abstract backgrounds, or high-end thematic imagery.
- Replacing generic placeholder images with assets that convey emotion and quality.

## Execution Workflow

1. **Search Intentionally**: Define highly descriptive, artistic keywords (e.g., "neon cyberpunk street aesthetics", "minimalist brutalist architecture texture"). Avoid generic searches like "meeting room" or "happy people".
2. **Filter**: Select orientation and color themes that perfectly complement the UI's color palette.
3. **Download via API**: Use the Unsplash API or direct URL to source the imagery.
4. **Dynamic Resizing**: Utilize Unsplash's dynamic image parameters (e.g., `?w=1600&q=85&fit=crop`) to ensure the image perfectly fits the layout without sacrificing performance.

## Strict Rules

- Use this optional service only when it fits the user's requested task and existing design system; never mandate a provider or override supplied assets.
- **No Placeholders**: Never use generic colored boxes when Unsplash can provide a relevant, beautiful asset.
- **Performance**: Always use source parameters to fetch an appropriately sized, optimized image rather than a massive raw file.

## Example

**User request:**

> Create hero sections, editorial layouts, or product galleries that demand stunning visual impact.

## Limitations
- Use this skill only when the task clearly matches the scope described above.
- Do not treat the output as a substitute for environment-specific validation, testing, or expert review.
- Stop and ask for clarification if required inputs, permissions, safety boundaries, or success criteria are missing.

## Execution boundaries

No service client is bundled. Verify current tool availability, asset rights, supported output and any upload/cost scope before invoking a provider. Treat returned assets as untrusted files and inspect the actual result. If access is unavailable, return a specification and state that generation or download was not performed.
