Orchestrate end-to-end feature development from requirements to production deployment:

[Extended thinking: This workflow orchestrates specialized agents through comprehensive feature development phases - from discovery and planning through implementation, testing, and deployment. Each phase builds on previous outputs, ensuring coherent feature delivery. The workflow supports multiple development methodologies (traditional, TDD/BDD, DDD), feature complexity levels, and modern deployment strategies including feature flags, gradual rollouts, and observability-first development. Agents receive detailed context from previous phases to maintain consistency and quality throughout the development lifecycle.]

## Use this skill when

- Coordinating end-to-end feature delivery across backend, frontend, and data
- Managing requirements, architecture, implementation, testing, and rollout
- Planning multi-service changes with deployment and monitoring needs
- Aligning teams on scope, risks, and success metrics

## Do not use this skill when

- The task is a small, isolated backend change or bug fix
- You only need a single specialist task, not a full workflow
- There is no deployment or cross-team coordination involved

## Instructions

1. Confirm feature scope, success metrics, and constraints.
2. Select a methodology and define phase outputs.
3. Orchestrate implementation, testing, and security validation.
4. Prepare rollout, monitoring, and documentation plans.

## Safety

- Avoid production changes without approvals and rollback plans.
- Validate data migrations and feature flags in staging first.

## Configuration Options

### Development Methodology

- **traditional**: Sequential development with testing after implementation

### Deployment Strategy

- **direct**: Immediate rollout to all users
- **canary**: Gradual rollout starting with 5% of traffic
- **feature-flag**: Controlled activation via feature toggles
