# Google Calendar

Lightweight Google Calendar integration with standalone OAuth authentication. No MCP server required.

> **⚠️ Requires Google Workspace account.** Personal Gmail accounts are not supported.

## When to Use
- You need to list, create, inspect, or update Google Calendar events from local scripts.
- The task requires OAuth-backed calendar automation without standing up an MCP server.
- You need quick operational access to calendars, schedules, attendees, or event details in a Workspace environment.

## Client Requirement

This bundle does not include `scripts/auth.py` or `scripts/gcal.py`. Treat the
commands below as an interface contract for a separately supplied, reviewed
client; do not run them unless those files exist locally and their OAuth scopes,
credential storage, and mutation behavior have been inspected. Fail closed if
the client cannot show the exact calendar, event, attendees, and notification
policy before a write.

## First-Time Setup

A conforming client can authenticate with Google (typically opening a browser):
```bash
python scripts/auth.py login
```

Check authentication status:
```bash
python scripts/auth.py status
```

Logout when needed:
```bash
python scripts/auth.py logout
```

## Commands

The interface examples below assume a separately supplied `scripts/gcal.py`.
Do not assume that it auto-authenticates or implements confirmation gates; verify
both behaviors before use.

### List Calendars
```bash
python scripts/gcal.py list-calendars
```

### List Events
```bash
# List events from primary calendar (default: next 30 days)
python scripts/gcal.py list-events

# List events with specific time range
python scripts/gcal.py list-events --time-min 2024-01-15T00:00:00Z --time-max 2024-01-31T23:59:59Z

# List events from a specific calendar
python scripts/gcal.py list-events --calendar "work@example.com"

# Limit results
python scripts/gcal.py list-events --max-results 10
```

### Get Event Details
```bash
python scripts/gcal.py get-event EVENT_ID
python scripts/gcal.py get-event EVENT_ID --calendar "work@example.com"
```

### Create Event

Before creation, display the target calendar, title, start/end with timezone,
attendees, and whether invitations will be sent. Require explicit confirmation
of that exact preview; cancellation or missing confirmation performs no write.

```bash
# Basic event
python scripts/gcal.py create-event "Team Meeting" "2024-01-15T10:00:00Z" "2024-01-15T11:00:00Z"

# Event with description and location
python scripts/gcal.py create-event "Team Meeting" "2024-01-15T10:00:00Z" "2024-01-15T11:00:00Z" \
    --description "Weekly sync" --location "Conference Room A"

# Event with attendees
python scripts/gcal.py create-event "Team Meeting" "2024-01-15T10:00:00Z" "2024-01-15T11:00:00Z" \
    --attendees user1@example.com user2@example.com

# Event on specific calendar
python scripts/gcal.py create-event "Meeting" "2024-01-15T10:00:00Z" "2024-01-15T11:00:00Z" \
    --calendar "work@example.com"
```

### Update Event

Fetch the current event, show a field-level diff plus notification policy, and
require explicit confirmation for the exact calendar and event ID before write.

```bash
# Update event title
python scripts/gcal.py update-event EVENT_ID --summary "New Title"

# Update event time
python scripts/gcal.py update-event EVENT_ID --start "2024-01-15T14:00:00Z" --end "2024-01-15T15:00:00Z"

# Update multiple fields
python scripts/gcal.py update-event EVENT_ID \
    --summary "Updated Meeting" --description "New agenda" --location "Room B"

# Update attendees
python scripts/gcal.py update-event EVENT_ID --attendees user1@example.com user3@example.com
```

### Delete Event

Show the event summary, calendar, time, attendees, and notification policy, then
require explicit confirmation. Never infer deletion approval from the request
to inspect or find an event.

```bash
python scripts/gcal.py delete-event EVENT_ID
python scripts/gcal.py delete-event EVENT_ID --calendar "work@example.com"
```

### Find Free Time
Find the first available slot for a meeting with specified attendees:
```bash
# Find 30-minute slot for yourself
python scripts/gcal.py find-free-time \
    --attendees me \
    --time-min "2024-01-15T09:00:00Z" \
    --time-max "2024-01-15T17:00:00Z" \
    --duration 30

# Find 60-minute slot with multiple attendees
python scripts/gcal.py find-free-time \
    --attendees me user1@example.com user2@example.com \
    --time-min "2024-01-15T09:00:00Z" \
    --time-max "2024-01-19T17:00:00Z" \
    --duration 60
```

### Respond to Event Invitation

Show the organizer, event, selected response, and organizer-notification choice,
then require explicit confirmation before sending the response.

```bash
# Accept an invitation
python scripts/gcal.py respond-to-event EVENT_ID accepted

# Decline an invitation
python scripts/gcal.py respond-to-event EVENT_ID declined

# Mark as tentative
python scripts/gcal.py respond-to-event EVENT_ID tentative

# Respond without notifying organizer
python scripts/gcal.py respond-to-event EVENT_ID accepted --no-notify
```

## Date/Time Format

All times use ISO 8601 format with timezone:
- UTC: `2024-01-15T10:30:00Z`
- With offset: `2024-01-15T10:30:00-05:00` (EST)

## Calendar ID Format

- Primary calendar: Use `primary` or omit the `--calendar` flag
- Other calendars: Use the calendar ID from `list-calendars` (usually an email address)

## Token Management

A conforming client should store tokens in the system keyring:
- **macOS**: Keychain
- **Windows**: Windows Credential Locker
- **Linux**: Secret Service API (GNOME Keyring, KDE Wallet, etc.)

Expected service name: `google-calendar-skill-oauth`. Verify this in the actual
client rather than assuming the storage contract is implemented.

Token refresh behavior depends on the separately supplied client. Verify its
implementation and OAuth scopes; do not assume a cloud function is present.

## Limitations
- Use this skill only when the task clearly matches the scope described above.
- Do not treat the output as a substitute for environment-specific validation, testing, or expert review.
- Stop and ask for clarification if required inputs, permissions, safety boundaries, or success criteria are missing.
