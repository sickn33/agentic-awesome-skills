> **⚠️ AUTHORIZED USE ONLY**
> This skill is for educational purposes or authorized security assessments only.
> You must have explicit, written permission from the system owner before using this tool.
> Misuse of this tool is illegal and strictly prohibited.

> **Mandatory confirmation gate**
> Before running any command that probes, exploits, changes, persists on, extracts data from, or attempts credential access against a target:
> 1. Ask the user to state the exact target URL, IP, account, or resource.
> 2. Ask the user to confirm written authorization and the permitted scope.
> 3. Show the exact command(s) and explain their expected effect.
> 4. Wait for explicit confirmation in the current conversation.
>
> Without that confirmation, remain read-only and provide defensive guidance only. Prefer a sandbox, disposable VM, or controlled lab.

# Offensive OSINT — External Red-Team Arsenal

> **v3.0** — Refactored 2026-05-02 from a 4,168-line monolith into a lean SKILL.md (~400 lines) plus 15 modular reference files in `references/`. Detail content loads on demand — Claude reads only the reference files relevant to the current task.


## 0. When to use / When NOT

**Use this skill when:**
- You need concrete probe paths, wordlists, regexes, payloads, scoring rules, or tool URLs.
- You're executing reconnaissance and need the actual technical reference (vs. methodology).
- You're building a recon automation and need specific lists to seed it.

**Do NOT use this skill when:**
- The user is asking for active exploitation, post-exploitation, or anything past reconnaissance.
- The user is asking for defensive / blue-team detections.
- The target's authorization isn't established — see §1.

---

## 1. Authorization & Legal Posture

For assets the operator owns or has written authorization to assess. Soft scope check before acting against an unverified third-party target — see methodology skill §1 for the full posture.

---

## 2. Confidence Levels

- **TENTATIVE** — plausible based on indirect evidence (snippet-only dork match, single-source asset, inferred email pattern).
- **FIRM** — directly observed (subdomain resolves, HEAD-confirmed bucket exists, banner returned).
- **CONFIRMED** — verified via independent corroboration OR direct verification (live PMAK validation, multiple sources agree, listable bucket with object retrieval).

---

## 3. Output Format Conventions

Findings should carry: `id`, `module`, `asset_key`, `category`, `severity` (info/low/medium/high/critical), `confidence`, `title`, `description`, `evidence` (url + UTC timestamp + sha256 + raw ≤ 2 KiB), `references`, `remediation`. UTC timestamps everywhere.

---

## 4. Source Hygiene & Citations

URL + UTC timestamp + SHA-256 + tool version + run_id, every artifact. PNG screenshots, JSONL run logs, raw HTTP captures capped at 2 KiB body.

---

## 5. Do NOT

- Don't paste creds/PII/session tokens into cloud LLMs.
- Don't run destructive probes outside DEEP/`--aggressive`.
- Don't use validated credentials for anything except read-only liveness check.
- Don't single-source attribute.
- Don't assume vendor labels are ground truth.

---

## How to use this skill

This skill is a **lean operational index**. Most concrete data (wordlists, regexes, dorks, endpoint catalogs, severity examples) lives in the `references/` subfolder, organized by topic.

**Workflow when this skill triggers:**

1. Read this SKILL.md to anchor on principles (§0-5), scoring rubrics (§20-21), attack-path templates (§39), and the references index below.
2. For task-specific data, **read only the reference file(s) you need** — do NOT pull all 15. Each reference is self-contained.
3. Use the `bug-bounty` skill for the local toolkit at `~/security-research/bug-bounty-resources/` and `osint-methodology` for the planning framework.

**Loading rules of thumb:**
- Single-class question (e.g., "what's the regex for AWS keys?") → load `secret-patterns.md` only.
- Multi-class engagement (e.g., "do an external recon on target.com") → load `probes-and-wordlists.md` first, then add others as the engagement narrows.
- Severity / triage question → load `severity-matrix.md`.

## 20. Endpoint Interest Score — 0–100 rubric

For every classified endpoint (§22 in methodology skill), apply this rubric:

| Signal | Points | Conditions |
|---|---|---|
| **Unauth write** | +40 | POST/PUT/DELETE/PATCH endpoint returns 200/201/202/204 anonymously. |
| **Open GraphQL introspection** | +35 | `__schema` query returns full type list anonymously. |
| **Verb tampering bypass** | +30 | OPTIONS reveals method not documented; that method is accessible. |
| **Reflected CORS + credentials** | +25 | `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` reflects request `Origin` AND `Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: true`. |
| **Sensitive keyword in path** | +20 | Path matches one of: `admin`, `internal`, `debug`, `user`, `password`, `token`, `key`, `export`, `upload`, `backup`, `config`, `secret`, `private`, `delete`, `purge`, `wipe`. |
| **Schema leak in error** | +20 | Response body contains stack trace, ORM error class, framework signature (e.g., `ActiveRecord::RecordNotFound`, `org.hibernate.exception.*`, `django.db.utils.IntegrityError`). |
| **API key in URL** | +15 | Path or query string contains `api_key=`, `apikey=`, `token=`, `access_token=`. |
| **Wildcard CORS** | +10 | `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *`. |
| **Missing rate-limit headers** | +10 | No `RateLimit-*` / `X-RateLimit-*` headers; no `Retry-After` after rapid requests. |

**Thresholds:**

| Score | Severity |
|---|---|
| ≥ 90 | **CRITICAL** |
| 70–89 | **HIGH** |
| 50–69 | MEDIUM |
| 25–49 | LOW |
| < 25 | INFO |

For score ≥ 70, attach an `attack_path_hint` in evidence (see §29).

---

## 21. Mobile App Ownership Confidence — 0–100 rubric

Before running deep APK static analysis, score whether the discovered app actually belongs to the target. Threshold: **≥70 = accept**.

| Signal | Points |
|---|---|
| Package reverse-DNS matches target domain (e.g., `com.acme.android` ⟂ `acme.com`) | +40 |
| Developer email is `<anything>@<target-domain>` | +25 |
| Developer website URL is the target domain (or a confirmed sibling brand domain) | +20 |
| App name contains a brand keyword from operator-supplied brand list | +10 |
| App has ≥ minimum review-score threshold (default 20 reviews) | +5 |

Apps below threshold are tagged `mobile_review_pending` and shown but not analyzed. Operator can re-score with `--mobile-ownership-threshold 50` for noisier collection.

---


---

## 39. Attack-Path Hint Patterns

When emitting a HIGH/CRITICAL API endpoint finding (score ≥ 70), include a one-sentence `attack_path_hint` in evidence so the operator knows where to start exploiting. Templates:

| Trigger | Attack-path hint |
|---|---|
| Unauth POST / PUT / DELETE | *"Unauthenticated {method} {path} — try IDOR + privilege escalation; check whether numeric IDs are sequential or guessable."* |
| Open GraphQL introspection | *"Open GraphQL introspection on {path} — enumerate mutations, look for `createUser`, `setRole`, `transferFunds`-shaped names; pivot to broken-auth or business-logic flaws."* |
| Reflected CORS + creds | *"Reflected CORS with credentials on {path} — host CSRF page on attacker-controlled origin; victim's browser will leak {sensitive-data-hint}."* |
| Wildcard CORS + sensitive | *"Wildcard CORS on {path} returning user-tied data without creds — exfiltrate via cross-origin fetch from any page victim visits."* |
| Verb tampering | *"Verb tampering: {hidden-method} allowed on documented-{visible-method}-only endpoint → likely missing-method-check authz bug; try {hidden-method} {path} with valid auth."* |
| API key in URL | *"API key in URL: `?{param}=...` — token leaks to access logs, browser history, Referer headers, third-party CDNs. Check Wayback / Google for cached copies."* |
| Schema leak in error | *"Schema leak in error response — framework signature `{framework}` exposed; map to known {framework} vulns and craft targeted payloads."* |
| Sensitive keyword | *"Path contains '{keyword}' — review for direct object reference, mass-assignment, or hidden admin functionality."* |
| Open RTDB Firebase | *"Open Firebase RTDB at https://{project}.firebaseio.com/.json — read everything, then test write at `/<random-key>.json` with PUT to gauge ACL scope."* |
| Listable cloud bucket | *"Listable {provider} bucket `{bucket}` — recursive object listing + content-type analysis; look for backups, logs, customer data, AWS keys in JSON configs."* |
| .git exposed | *"Exposed .git/config on {host} — reconstruct repository with git-dumper or githacker; full source history."* |
| .env exposed | *"Exposed .env on {host} — grep for `_KEY`, `_SECRET`, `_TOKEN`, `_PASSWORD`; validate all credentials read-only via §23 validators."* |
| /actuator/env | *"Spring Boot /actuator/env exposed — dump environment variables; look for `spring.datasource.password`, JWT secrets, cloud creds."* |
| /actuator/heapdump | *"Spring Boot /actuator/heapdump exposed — download HPROF, run `jhat` or VisualVM, search for cleartext secrets in heap strings."* |
| Open Elasticsearch | *"Open Elasticsearch on {host}:9200 — `/_cat/indices?v` for index list; sample documents from each high-value index; test write to `/test-idx/_doc` to gauge ACL."* |
| Open Redis | *"Open Redis on {host}:6379 — `INFO`, `KEYS *`, sample reads; check for write access via `CONFIG SET` then `BGSAVE` to write `authorized_keys`."* |
| Open MongoDB | *"Open MongoDB on {host}:27017 — `show dbs`, `show collections`, sample find queries; check user collection for password hashes."* |
| Subdomain takeover | *"CNAME for {host} points to unclaimed {provider} resource → register `{takeover-target}` on {provider} to serve content from {host}; pivot to phishing or content injection on the trusted domain."* |
| Open kubelet | *"Open kubelet on {host}:10250 — `GET /pods` to list; `POST /run/<ns>/<pod>/<container>` for in-container exec without K8s API auth."* |
| Open etcd | *"Open etcd on {host}:2379 — `etcdctl get / --prefix --keys-only` for full cluster state; secrets stored under `/registry/secrets/`."* |
| K8s API anonymous | *"Kubernetes API on {host}:6443 with anonymous-auth — `kubectl --server=https://{host}:6443 --insecure-skip-tls-verify get pods --all-namespaces`."* |
| Citrix unpatched | *"Citrix NetScaler version {ver} on {host} — vulnerable to CVE-{cve} (KEV-listed); see vendor advisory; do not exploit but flag for client immediate patching."* |
| F5 BIG-IP TMUI exposed | *"F5 BIG-IP TMUI on {host} reachable; CVE-2022-1388 / CVE-2023-46747 KEV applicable; advise immediate patching to vendor-released hotfix."* |
| VMware vCenter accessible | *"vCenter at {host} accessible without VPN; CVE-2021-21972 RCE if unpatched; check version banner."* |
| Cloud function URL unauth | *"AWS Lambda Function URL at {url} accessible anonymously — review IAM auth configuration; if unauthenticated by design, audit input validation aggressively."* |
| npm typosquat candidate | *"Package name `{candidate}` is unregistered + similar to target's published `{official}` — typosquat takeover risk; advise client to defensively register."* |
| DMARC missing/permissive | *"DMARC `p=none` on {domain} — spoof of `{anything}@{domain}` deliverable to recipients; recommend enforcement to `p=quarantine` or `p=reject` after observing reports."* |
| Live AI API key (Anthropic/OpenAI) | *"Validated `sk-{provider}-...` key with model access — quota cost can be exfiltrated; rotate immediately + audit usage logs in provider console."* |
| Public Slack invite link | *"Slack workspace invite link discoverable via search engine — anyone can join the workspace without approval; trivially access internal channels."* |
| Open Docker registry | *"Public Docker registry at {host} — `GET /v2/_catalog` lists images; pull and scan layers for embedded secrets."* |
| Telegram bot token live | *"Telegram bot token validated — `getUpdates` reveals bot recipients (admin chats); if `getMe` shows bot is in channels, full message read access."* |
| Sourcemap with `sourcesContent[]` | *"Sourcemap on {host} includes embedded original sources — full frontend code reconstructable; grep for inline secrets and internal hostnames."* |

## 50. Changelog

- **v2.1.1 (2026-04-27)** — battle-test gap fixes from real-engagement smoke run. Added: §15.0.1 HudsonRock Cavalier direct-API recipe (curl + PowerShell, full JSON shape, free-tier redaction caveats, rate-limit guidance). §15.2 expanded with legacy-mail-decommissioned escalation pattern (NXDOMAIN legacy mail + breach corpus + autodiscover-confirmed cloud migration → CRITICAL SSO_EXPOSURE). §16.14 expanded with DMARC reporting-vendor table (Kratikal kdmarc / dmarcian / Valimail / Agari / EasyDMARC / DMARC Analyzer / Postmark) + full Windows/PowerShell parallel for the entire email security audit + caveat that PS 5.1 `Resolve-DnsName -Type CAA` errors (use PS 7+ or `nslookup -type=CAA`). §16.22 expanded TXT verification token catalog with 17 new tokens (zscaler-verification, cloudflare-verify, autosect, cisco-site-verification, mscid, _amazonses, salesforce-domain-verification, workday/shopify/klaviyo/mailchimp/hubspot/zendesk/freshworks/intercom/loom/miro/gitlab) + new "Autodiscover-as-confirmation" pattern for M365 detection when MX is wrapped by Mimecast/Proofpoint/Barracuda. §22.1 added passive Autodiscover IP correlation pattern with Microsoft Exchange Online IP ranges. §22.8 added clarification: SharePoint HEAD HTTP 200 = tenant exists, NOT anonymous access granted (operators commonly misread). New §16.23 legacy-app pivot block (when Wayback `*.js` returns empty for brochure-ware sites, pivot to .asp/.php/.jsp/.cfm/.aspx/.json/.xml/.yml/.ini/.conf — with full broad-sweep one-liner). New §16.24 Common-Prefix Subdomain Sweep — formalized active prefix-probe technique with 100+ ordered prefix list, PowerShell + bash + puredns recipes, and real-engagement validation note (passive enum misses 20-40% of high-value subdomains; always pair with active prefix probe). §27.0.1 added crt.sh fallback chain (Censys, CertSpotter, Calidog, Subfinder, OTX, ThreatMiner, URLScan, Anubis-DB) with PowerShell wrapper that retries crt.sh 3× then falls back to Subfinder. §28.1 added Bulk IP→ASN recipes (Cymru bulk WHOIS, RIPEstat, bgp.tools, IPinfo Lite) + caveat that bgpview.io API has aggressive rate limits unsuitable for bulk. §40 severity matrix gained 8 rows: vendor procurement portal exposed + breach corpus hits (HIGH), PII-collection portal over plain HTTP (HIGH), decommissioned legacy mail + breach + cloud migration (CRITICAL), public-facing intranet without VPN (MEDIUM), staging/preprod publicly resolvable (MEDIUM), vpn.<domain> resolves but vendor unknown (INFO escalating to HIGH-CRITICAL on KEV match), DMARC RUA → third-party vendor (INFO). §49 self-test expanded from 30 → 40 prompts targeting all new content.

Added §23.12 post-discovery enumeration workflows (AWS IAM enum, GitHub PAT scope/repo enum, Slack workspace enum, JWT full triage with algorithm-confusion + brute-force + none-bypass, Postman PMAK workspace enum, Anthropic + OpenAI usage enum, generic key provenance enum). Pinned §24 Postman search endpoint with verified shape + DevTools fallback recipe. Added §27.1 wordlist sources (Assetnote, SecLists, jhaddix, OneListForAll, raft-large-words, fuzzdb, etc.) + size guidance. Added §28.4 TLS deep audit (sslyze + testssl.sh + nmap + JA3/JA4 + cipher/protocol/cert checks). Added §28.5 reverse DNS sweep + IPv6 enumeration + BGP route observation. Added §29.2 vulnerability prioritization data sources (NVD/EPSS/CISA KEV/ExploitDB/Metasploit/InTheWild/OpenCVE/Trickest CVE+POC mapping/OSV.dev/VulnCheck KEV) + bulk prioritization workflow. Expanded §39 attack-path hints with 15 more templates (open kubelet/etcd, K8s API anonymous, Citrix/F5/vCenter/Cloud Function unauth, npm typosquat, DMARC missing, live AI keys, Slack invite, sourcemap with sourcesContent). Expanded §40 severity matrix with 30 more worked examples covering Kubernetes/container, vendor products with KEV CVEs, M365/cloud-native, CI/CD misconfig, documentation leaks, email-security gaps, AI/package-registry credentials, TLS issues. Added §41 LinkedIn employee enumeration tradecraft (search techniques + role inference + email-pattern derivation + sock-puppet considerations). Added §42 job posting tech-stack analysis (sources + extraction + tooling). Added §43 Slack/Discord/Telegram/Mattermost workspace discovery. Added §44 package registry leak hunting (npm/PyPI/RubyGems/Cargo/Packagist/NuGet/Maven Central + workflow + typosquat surveillance). Added §45 sat imagery for physical recon (sources + extraction + LinkedIn/Glassdoor/Instagram/conference intel + vehicle/fleet intel). Added §46 tooling quick-install (subdomain, HTTP probing, vuln scanning, content discovery, JS extraction, Wayback, cloud, identity, mobile, TLS, utilities, frameworks). Added §47 sector-specific recon notes (healthcare DICOM/HL7/FHIR/EHR + finance SWIFT/FIX/Bloomberg/banking middleware + ICS-SCADA Modbus/BACnet/S7/DNP3 + IoT MQTT/CoAP/UPnP + government FedRAMP/FISMA + maritime/aviation/auto). Renumbered Runnable Helper → §48, Self-Test → §49 (refreshed for v2.1), Changelog → §50.
- **v2.0 (2026-04-27)** — major rewrite for external red-team posture.

## Related Skills & Chains

- **`web2-recon`** — When the arsenal needs to be executed against a live host set. Workflow primitive: this skill provides the probe paths and wordlists; `web2-recon` runs the actual subfinder → dnsx → httpx → katana pipeline that consumes them.
- **`osint-methodology`** — When this skill's concrete probes need a planning framework. Workflow primitive: `osint-methodology` is the planning skeleton (5-stage pipeline, asset graph, findings rubric); this skill is the operational arsenal that fills each stage with curl one-liners and regexes.
- **`hunt-subdomain`** — When this skill's subdomain enumeration finds stale CNAMEs. Workflow primitive: subdomains discovered via §27 / `references/recon-stack.md` get auto-routed to `hunt-subdomain` for takeover validation.
- **`hunt-cloud-misconfig`** — When this skill's cloud-bucket enum surfaces listable buckets / Firebase / actuator endpoints. Workflow primitive: §39 attack-path hints (listable bucket, /actuator/env, open Elasticsearch) hand off to `hunt-cloud-misconfig` for exploitation.
- **`m365-entra-attack`** / **`okta-attack`** — When identity-fabric fingerprinting finds Entra/Okta. Workflow primitive: `references/identity-fabric.md` fingerprints the IdP; matched platform skill (loaded by `hunt-dispatch`) takes over for active enumeration.

## When to Use

- You have explicit, written authorization to assess the target in scope, and the task matches this skill's vulnerability class or technique within a bug-bounty or penetration-test engagement.
- You need the recon, exploitation, or validation workflow described below — executed strictly inside the approved scope.

## Limitations

- Authorized scope only: the confirmation gate above is mandatory before any probing, exploitation, or credential-access command.
- Docs-only import: upstream helper scripts, commands, engine, and research assets are not bundled; reinstall tooling from the source repo when needed.
- Validate every finding (see `triage-validation`) before reporting; report via `report-writing`. Prefer a sandbox, disposable VM, or controlled lab.

### Example

```bash
# Read-only first step; confirm scope before anything active.
cat scope.txt  # target list from the authorized engagement brief
```
