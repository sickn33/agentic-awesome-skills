# Agent Memory Skill

This skill provides a persistent, searchable memory bank that automatically syncs with project documentation. It runs as an MCP server to allow reading/writing/searching of long-term memories.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js (v18+)

## Setup

1. **Review the Repository**:
   Ask the user to approve network access to the named repository, then clone the
   pinned revision into a temporary directory, not an active skills path:

   ```bash
   review_dir="$(mktemp -d)"
   git clone --filter=blob:none https://github.com/webzler/agentMemory.git "$review_dir/agent-memory"
   git -C "$review_dir/agent-memory" checkout --detach 0409b7b7bb6fe443d0d4b6a6b1ee0d4df214f3cd
   git -C "$review_dir/agent-memory" ls-files
   ```

   Read all bundled files and inspect `package.json`, lockfiles, lifecycle
   scripts, network behavior, credential access, and filesystem scope. Show the
   findings and exact commit, then wait for explicit user approval.

2. **Install the Reviewed Revision**:

   Copy the reviewed tree to a user-selected location after approval. Install
   locked dependencies only after the package scripts have been reviewed:

   ```bash
   cd <approved-agent-memory-directory>
   npm ci
   npm run compile
   ```

3. **Start the MCP Server**:
   Use the helper script to activate the memory bank for your current project:

   ```bash
   npm run start-server <project_id> <absolute_path_to_target_workspace>
   ```

   _Example for current directory:_

   ```bash
   npm run start-server my-project $(pwd)
   ```

## Capabilities (MCP Tools)

### `memory_search`

Search for memories by query, type, or tags.

- **Args**: `query` (string), `type?` (string), `tags?` (string[])
- **Usage**: "Find all authentication patterns" -> `memory_search({ query: "authentication", type: "pattern" })`

### `memory_write`

Record new knowledge or decisions.

- **Args**: `key` (string), `type` (string), `content` (string), `tags?` (string[])
- **Usage**: "Save this architecture decision" -> `memory_write({ key: "auth-v1", type: "decision", content: "..." })`

### `memory_read`

Retrieve specific memory content by key.

- **Args**: `key` (string)
- **Usage**: "Get the auth design" -> `memory_read({ key: "auth-v1" })`

### `memory_stats`

View analytics on memory usage.

- **Usage**: "Show memory statistics" -> `memory_stats({})`

## Dashboard

This skill includes a standalone dashboard to visualize memory usage.

```bash
npm run start-dashboard <absolute_path_to_target_workspace>
```

## When to Use
This skill is applicable to execute the workflow or actions described in the overview.

## Limitations
- Use this skill only when the task clearly matches the scope described above.
- Do not treat the output as a substitute for environment-specific validation, testing, or expert review.
- Stop and ask for clarification if required inputs, permissions, safety boundaries, or success criteria are missing.
- Re-review upstream before changing the pinned revision; a commit pin improves reproducibility but is not a trust guarantee.
