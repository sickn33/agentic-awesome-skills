# Strategic SEO Planning

## When to Use
- Use when building an SEO strategy or roadmap for a new or existing site.
- Use when planning content, architecture, and implementation phases together.
- Use when the user asks for an SEO plan rather than a point-in-time audit.

## Process

### 1. Discovery
- Business type, target audience, competitors, goals
- Current site assessment (if exists)
- Budget and timeline constraints
- Key performance indicators (KPIs)

### 2. Competitive Analysis
- Identify top 5 competitors
- Analyze their content strategy, schema usage, technical setup
- Identify keyword gaps and content opportunities
- Assess their E-E-A-T signals
- Estimate their domain authority

### 3. Architecture Design
- Load industry template from `assets/` directory
- Design URL hierarchy and content pillars
- Plan internal linking strategy
- Sitemap structure with quality gates applied
- Information architecture for user journeys

### 4. Content Strategy
- Content gaps vs competitors
- Page types and estimated counts
- Blog/resource topics and publishing cadence
- E-E-A-T building plan (author bios, credentials, experience signals)
- Content calendar with priorities

### 5. Technical Foundation
- Hosting and performance requirements
- Schema markup plan per page type
- Core Web Vitals baseline targets
- AI search readiness requirements
- Mobile-first considerations

### 6. Implementation Roadmap (4 phases)

#### Phase 1: Foundation (weeks 1-4)
- Technical setup and infrastructure
- Core pages (home, about, contact, main services)
- Essential schema implementation
- Analytics and tracking setup

#### Phase 2: Expansion (weeks 5-12)
- Content creation for primary pages
- Blog launch with initial posts
- Internal linking structure
- Local SEO setup (if applicable)

#### Phase 3: Scale (weeks 13-24)
- Advanced content development
- Link building and outreach
- GEO optimization
- Performance optimization

#### Phase 4: Authority (months 7-12)
- Thought leadership content
- PR and media mentions
- Advanced schema implementation
- Continuous optimization

## Industry Templates

Load from `assets/` directory:
- `saas.md`: SaaS/software companies
- `local-service.md`: Local service businesses
- `ecommerce.md`: E-commerce stores
- `publisher.md`: Content publishers/media
- `agency.md`: Agencies and consultancies
- `generic.md`: General business template

## Output

### Deliverables
- `SEO-STRATEGY.md`: Complete strategic plan
- `COMPETITOR-ANALYSIS.md`: Competitive insights
- `CONTENT-CALENDAR.md`: Content roadmap
- `IMPLEMENTATION-ROADMAP.md`: Phased action plan
- `SITE-STRUCTURE.md`: URL hierarchy and architecture

### KPI Targets
| Metric | Baseline | 3 Month | 6 Month | 12 Month |
|--------|----------|---------|---------|----------|
| Organic Traffic | ... | ... | ... | ... |
| Keyword Rankings | ... | ... | ... | ... |
| Domain Authority | ... | ... | ... | ... |
| Indexed Pages | ... | ... | ... | ... |
| Core Web Vitals | ... | ... | ... | ... |

### Success Criteria
- Clear, measurable goals per phase
- Resource requirements defined
- Dependencies identified
- Risk mitigation strategies

## DataForSEO Integration (Optional)

If DataForSEO MCP tools are available, use `dataforseo_labs_google_competitors_domain` and `dataforseo_labs_google_domain_intersection` for real competitive intelligence, `dataforseo_labs_bulk_traffic_estimation` for traffic estimates, `kw_data_google_ads_search_volume` and `dataforseo_labs_bulk_keyword_difficulty` for keyword research, and `business_data_business_listings_search` for local business data.

## Error Handling

| Scenario | Action |
|----------|--------|
| Unrecognized business type | Fall back to `generic.md` template. Inform user that no industry-specific template was found and proceed with the general business template. |
| No website URL provided | Proceed with new-site planning mode. Skip current site assessment and competitive gap analysis that require a live URL. |
| Industry template not found | Check `assets/` directory for available templates. If the requested template file is missing, use `generic.md` and note the missing template in output. |

## Limitations
- Use this skill only when the task clearly matches the scope described above.
- Do not treat the output as a substitute for environment-specific validation, testing, or expert review.
- Stop and ask for clarification if required inputs, permissions, safety boundaries, or success criteria are missing.
