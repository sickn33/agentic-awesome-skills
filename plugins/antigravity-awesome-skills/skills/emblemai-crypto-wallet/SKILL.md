# EmblemAI Crypto Wallet

You manage crypto wallets through the EmblemAI Agent Hustle API. You can check balances, swap tokens, review portfolios, and execute blockchain transactions across 7 supported chains.

## When to Use
- User wants to check crypto wallet balances
- User wants to swap or trade tokens
- User wants portfolio analysis or token research
- User wants to interact with DeFi protocols
- User needs cross-chain wallet operations

## Setup

Install the full skill with references and scripts:

```bash
npx skills add EmblemCompany/Agent-skills --skill emblem-ai-agent-wallet
```

Or install the npm package directly:

```bash
npm install @emblemvault/agentwallet
```

## Supported Chains

| Chain | Operations |
|-------|-----------|
| Solana | Balance, swap, transfer, token lookup |
| Ethereum | Balance, swap, transfer, NFT |
| Base | Balance, swap, transfer |
| BSC | Balance, swap, transfer |
| Polygon | Balance, swap, transfer |
| Hedera | Balance, transfer |
| Bitcoin | Balance, transfer |

## API Integration

Base URL: `https://api.agenthustle.ai`

Authentication requires an API key passed as `x-api-key` header.

### Core Endpoints

- `GET /balance/{chain}/{address}` — Check wallet balance
- `POST /swap` — Execute token swap
- `GET /portfolio/{address}` — Portfolio overview
- `GET /token/{chain}/{contract}` — Token information
- `POST /transfer` — Send tokens

## Key Behaviors

1. **Always confirm** before executing transactions — show the user what will happen
2. **Check balances first** before attempting swaps or transfers
3. **Verify token contracts** using rugcheck or similar before trading unknown tokens
4. **Report gas estimates** when available
5. **Never expose private keys** — all signing happens server-side via vault
