# Brand Guidelines

Write user-facing copy following Sentry's brand guidelines.

## When to Use
- You need to write or rewrite user-facing copy in Sentry's voice.
- The task involves UI text, onboarding, empty states, docs, marketing copy, or other branded content.
- You need guidance on when to use Plain Speech versus Sentry Voice.

## Tone Selection

Choose the appropriate tone based on context:

| Use Plain Speech | Use Sentry Voice |
|------------------|------------------|
| Product UI (buttons, labels, forms) | 404 pages |
| Documentation | Empty states |
| Error messages | Onboarding flows |
| Settings pages | Loading states |
| Transactional emails | "What's New" announcements |
| Help text | Marketing copy |

**Default to Plain Speech** unless the context specifically calls for personality.

## Plain Speech (Default)

Plain Speech is clear, direct, and functional. Use it for most UI elements.

### Rules

1. **Be concise** - Use the fewest words needed
2. **Be direct** - Tell users what to do, not what they can do
3. **Use active voice** - "Save your changes" not "Your changes will be saved"
4. **Avoid jargon** - Use simple words users understand
5. **Be specific** - "3 errors found" not "Some errors found"

### Examples

| Instead of | Write |
|------------|-------|
| "Click here to save your changes" | "Save" |
| "You can filter results by date" | "Filter by date" |
| "An error has occurred" | "Something went wrong" |
| "Please enter a valid email address" | "Enter a valid email" |
| "Are you sure you want to delete?" | "Delete this item?" |

## Sentry Voice

Sentry Voice adds personality in appropriate moments. It's empathetic, self-aware, and occasionally snarky.

### Principles

1. **Empathetic snark** - Direct frustration at the situation, never the user
2. **Self-aware** - Acknowledge the absurdity of software
3. **Fun but functional** - Personality should enhance, not obscure meaning
4. **Earned moments** - Only use when users have time to appreciate it

### Examples

**404 Pages:**
> "This page doesn't exist. Maybe it never did. Maybe it was a dream. Either way, let's get you back on track."

**Empty States:**
> "No errors yet. Enjoy this moment of peace while it lasts."

**Onboarding:**
> "Let's get your first error. Don't worry, it's not as scary as it sounds."

**Loading States:**
> "Crunching the numbers..."
> "Fetching your data..."

### When NOT to Use Sentry Voice

- Error messages (users are frustrated)
- Settings pages (users are focused)
- Documentation (users need information)
- Billing/payment flows (users need trust)

## General Rules

### Spelling and Grammar

- Use **American English** spelling (color, not colour)
- Use **Title Case** for headings and page titles
- Use **Sentence case** for body text, buttons, and labels

### Punctuation

- **No exclamation marks** in UI text (exception: celebratory moments)
- **No periods** in short UI labels or button text
- **Use periods** in complete sentences and help text
- **No ALL CAPS** except for acronyms (API, SDK, URL)

### Word Choices

| Avoid | Prefer |
|-------|--------|
| Please | (omit) |
| Sorry | (be specific about the problem) |
| Error occurred | Something went wrong |
| Invalid | (explain what's wrong) |
| Success! | (describe what happened) |
| Oops | (be specific) |

## Dash Usage

| Type | Use | Example |
|------|-----|---------|
| Hyphen (-) | Compound words, ranges | "real-time", "1-10" |
| En-dash (--) | Ranges, relationships | "2023--2024", "parent--child" |
| Em-dash (---) | Interruption, emphasis | "Errors---even small ones---matter" |

In most UI contexts, use hyphens. Reserve en-dashes for date ranges and em-dashes for longer prose.

## UI Element Guidelines

### Buttons

- Use action verbs: "Save", "Delete", "Create"
- Be specific: "Create Project" not just "Create"
- Max 2-3 words when possible
- No periods or exclamation marks

### Error Messages

1. Say what happened
2. Say why (if helpful)
3. Say what to do next

**Good:** "Could not save changes. Check your connection and try again."
**Bad:** "Error: Save failed."

### Empty States

1. Explain what would normally be here
2. Provide a clear action to populate the state
3. Sentry Voice is appropriate here

**Good:** "No projects yet. Create your first project to start tracking errors."

### Confirmation Dialogs

- Make the action clear in the title
- Explain consequences if destructive
- Use specific button labels ("Delete Project", not "OK")

### Tooltips and Help Text

- Keep under 2 sentences
- Explain the "why", not just the "what"
- Link to docs for complex topics

## Anti-Patterns

Avoid these common mistakes:

- **Robot speak:** "Item has been successfully deleted" -> "Deleted"
- **Passive voice:** "Changes were saved" -> "Changes saved"
- **Unnecessary words:** "In order to" -> "To"
- **Hedging:** "This might cause..." -> "This will cause..."
- **Double negatives:** "Not unlike..." -> "Similar to..."
- **Marketing speak in UI:** "Supercharge your workflow" -> "Speed up your workflow"
