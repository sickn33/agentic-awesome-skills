# antigravity-skill-orchestrator

## Overview

The `skill-orchestrator` is a meta-skill designed to enhance the AI agent's ability to tackle complex problems. It acts as an intelligent coordinator that first evaluates the complexity of a user's request. Based on that evaluation, it determines if specialized skills are needed. If they are, it selects the right combination of skills, explicitly tracks these combinations using `@agent-memory-mcp` for future reference, and guides the agent through the execution process. Crucially, it includes strict guardrails to prevent the unnecessary use of specialized skills for simple tasks that can be solved with baseline capabilities.

## When to Use This Skill

- Use when tackling a complex, multi-step problem that likely requires multiple domains of expertise.
- Use when you are unsure which specific skills are best suited for a given user request, and need to discover them from the broader ecosystem.
- Use when the user explicitly asks to "orchestrate", "combine skills", or "use the best tools for the job" on a significant task.
- Use when you want to look up previously successful combinations of skills for a specific type of problem.

## Core Concepts

### Task Evaluation Guardrails
Not every task requires a specialized skill. For straightforward issues (e.g., small CSS fixes, simple script writing, renaming a variable), **DO NOT USE** specialized skills. Over-engineering simple tasks wastes tokens and time. 

Additionally, the orchestrator is strictly forbidden from creating new skills. Its sole purpose is to combine and use existing skills provided by the community or present in the current environment.

Before invoking any skills, evaluate the task:
1. **Is the task simple/contained?** Solve it directly using the agent's ordinary file editing, search, and terminal capabilities available in the current environment.
2. **Is the task complex/multi-domain?** Only then should you proceed to orchestrate skills.

### Skill Selection & Combinations
When a task is deemed complex, identify the necessary domains (e.g., frontend, database, deployment). Search available skills in the current environment to find the most relevant ones. If the required skills are not found locally, consult the master skill catalog.

### Master Skill Catalog
The Antigravity ecosystem maintains a master catalog of highly curated skills at `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sickn33/antigravity-awesome-skills/main/CATALOG.md`. When local skills are insufficient, fetch this catalog to discover appropriate skills across the 9 primary categories:
- `architecture`
- `business`
- `data-ai`
- `development`
- `general`
- `infrastructure`
- `security`
- `testing`
- `workflow`

### Memory Integration (`@agent-memory-mcp`)
To build institutional knowledge, the orchestrator relies on the `agent-memory-mcp` skill to record and retrieve successful skill combinations.

## Step-by-Step Guide

### 1. Task Evaluation & Guardrail Check
[Triggered when facing a new user request that might need skills]
1. Read the user's request.
2. Ask yourself: "Can I solve this efficiently with just basic file editing and terminal commands?"
3. If YES: Proceed without invoking specialized skills. Stop the orchestration here.
4. If NO: Proceed to step 2.

### 2. Retrieve Past Knowledge
[Triggered if the task is complex]
1. Use the `memory_search` tool provided by `agent-memory-mcp` to search for similar past tasks.
   - Example query: `memory_search({ query: "skill combination for react native and firebase", type: "skill_combination" })`
2. If a working combination exists, read the details using `memory_read`.
3. If no relevant memory exists, proceed to Step 3.

### 3. Discover and Select Skills
[Triggered if no past knowledge covers this task]
1. Analyze the core requirements (e.g., "needs a React UI, a Node.js backend, and a PostgreSQL database").
2. Query the locally available skills using the current environment's skill list or equivalent discovery mechanism to find the best match for each requirement.
3. **If local skills are insufficient**, fetch the master catalog with the web or command-line retrieval tools available in the current environment: `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sickn33/antigravity-awesome-skills/main/CATALOG.md`.
4. Scan the catalog's 9 main categories to identify the appropriate skills to bring into the current context.
5. Select the minimal set of skills needed. **Do not over-select.**

### 4. Apply Skills and Track the Combination
[Triggered after executing the task using the selected skills]
1. Assume the task was completed successfully using a new combination of skills (e.g., `@react-patterns` + `@nodejs-backend-patterns` + `@postgresql`).
2. Record this combination for future use using `memory_write` from `agent-memory-mcp`.
   - Ensure the type is `skill_combination`.
   - Provide a descriptive key and content detailing why these skills worked well together.

## Examples

### Example 1: Handling a Simple Task (The Guardrail in Action)
**User Request:** "Change the color of the submit button in `index.css` to blue."
**Action:** The skill orchestrator evaluates the task. It determines this is a "simple/contained" task. It **does not** invoke specialized skills. It directly edits `index.css`.

### Example 2: Recording a New Skill Combination
```javascript
// Using the agent-memory-mcp tool after successfully building a complex feature
memory_write({ 
  key: "combination-ecommerce-checkout", 
  type: "skill_combination", 
  content: "For e-commerce checkouts, using @stripe-integration combined with @react-state-management and @postgresql effectively handles the full flow from UI state to payment processing to order recording.",
  tags: ["ecommerce", "checkout", "stripe", "react"]
})
```

### Example 3: Retrieving a Combination
```javascript
// At the start of a new e-commerce task
memory_search({ 
  query: "ecommerce checkout", 
  type: "skill_combination" 
})
// Returns the key "combination-ecommerce-checkout", which you then read:
memory_read({ key: "combination-ecommerce-checkout" })
```

## Best Practices

- ✅ **Do:** Always evaluate task complexity *before* looking for skills.
- ✅ **Do:** Keep the number of orchestrated skills as small as possible.
- ✅ **Do:** Use highly descriptive keys when running `memory_write` so they are easy to search later.
- ❌ **Don't:** Use this skill for simple bug fixes or UI tweaks.
- ❌ **Don't:** Combine skills that have overlapping and conflicting instructions without a clear plan to resolve the conflict.
- ❌ **Don't:** Attempt to construct, generate, or create new skills. Only combine what is available.

## Related Skills

- `@agent-memory-mcp` - Essential for this skill to function. Provides the persistent storage for skill combinations.

## Limitations
- Use this skill only when the task clearly matches the scope described above.
- Do not treat the output as a substitute for environment-specific validation, testing, or expert review.
- Stop and ask for clarification if required inputs, permissions, safety boundaries, or success criteria are missing.
