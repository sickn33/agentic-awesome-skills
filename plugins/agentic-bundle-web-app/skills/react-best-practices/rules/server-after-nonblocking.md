## Use after() for Non-Blocking Operations

Use Next.js's `after()` to schedule work that should execute after a response is sent. This prevents logging, analytics, and other side effects from blocking the response.

**Incorrect (blocks response):**

```tsx
import { logUserAction } from '@/app/utils'

export async function POST(request: Request) {
  // Perform mutation
  await updateDatabase(request)
  
  // Logging blocks the response
  const userAgent = request.headers.get('user-agent') || 'unknown'
  await logUserAction({ userAgent })
  
  return new Response(JSON.stringify({ status: 'success' }), {
    status: 200,
    headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' }
  })
}
```

**Correct (non-blocking):**

```tsx
import { after } from 'next/server'
import { headers } from 'next/headers'
import { logUserAction } from '@/app/utils'

export async function POST(request: Request) {
  // Perform mutation
  await updateDatabase(request)
  
  // Log after response is sent
  after(async () => {
    const userAgent = (await headers()).get('user-agent') || 'unknown'
    
    await logUserAction({ userAgent })
  })
  
  return new Response(JSON.stringify({ status: 'success' }), {
    status: 200,
    headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' }
  })
}
```

The response is sent immediately while logging happens in the background.

**Common use cases:**

- Analytics tracking
- Best-effort diagnostic logging
- Optional diagnostics
- Non-critical cache housekeeping
- Cleanup tasks

**Important notes:**

- `after()` runs even if the response fails or redirects
- Works in Server Actions, Route Handlers, and Server Components

Reference: [https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/functions/after](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/functions/after)

Use after only on a supporting Next version/hosting adapter and within its execution deadline. Await asynchronous logging inside its callback. Do not log session cookies, tokens or full request data. Required audit records, durable notifications, mutations and security-critical invalidation need a durable awaited path or queue; after is not delivery assurance.
