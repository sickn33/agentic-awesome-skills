# XVARY Stock Research Skill

Use this skill to produce institutional-depth stock analysis in Claude Code using public EDGAR + market data.

## When to Use
- Use when you need a **verdict-style equity memo** (constructive / neutral / cautious) grounded in **public** filings and quotes.
- Use when you want **named kill criteria** and a **four-pillar scorecard** (Momentum, Stability, Financial Health, Upside) without a paid data terminal.
- Use when comparing two tickers with `/compare` and need a structured differential, not a prose-only chat answer.

## Commands

### `/analyze {ticker}`

Run full skill workflow:

1. Pull SEC fundamentals and filing metadata from `tools/edgar.py`.
2. Pull quote and valuation context from `tools/market.py`.
3. Apply framework from `references/methodology.md`.
4. Compute scorecard using `references/scoring.md`.
5. Output structured analysis with verdict, pillars, risks, and kill criteria.

### `/score {ticker}`

Run score-only workflow:

1. Pull minimum required EDGAR and market fields.
2. Compute Momentum, Stability, Financial Health, and Upside Estimate.
3. Return score table + short interpretation + top sensitivity checks.

### `/compare {ticker1} vs {ticker2}`

Run side-by-side workflow:

1. Execute `/score` logic for both tickers.
2. Compare conviction drivers, key risks, and valuation asymmetry.
3. Return winner by setup quality, plus conditions that would flip the view.

## Execution Rules

- Normalize all tickers to uppercase.
- Prefer latest annual + quarterly EDGAR datapoints.
- Cite filing form/date whenever stating a hard financial figure.
- Keep analysis concise but decision-oriented.
- Use plain English, avoid generic finance fluff.
- Never claim certainty; surface assumptions and kill criteria.

## Output Format

For `/analyze {ticker}` use this shape:

1. `Verdict` (Constructive / Neutral / Cautious)
2. `Conviction Rationale` (3-5 bullets)
3. `XVARY Scores` (Momentum, Stability, Financial Health, Upside)
4. `Thesis Pillars` (3-5 pillars)
5. `Top Risks` (3 items)
6. `Kill Criteria` (thesis-invalidating conditions)
7. `Financial Snapshot` (revenue, margin proxy, cash flow, leverage snapshot)
8. `Next Checks` (what to watch over next 1-2 quarters)

For `/score {ticker}` use this shape:

1. Score table
2. Factor highlights by score
3. Confidence note

For `/compare {ticker1} vs {ticker2}` use this shape:

1. Score comparison table
2. Where ticker A is stronger
3. Where ticker B is stronger
4. What would change the ranking
