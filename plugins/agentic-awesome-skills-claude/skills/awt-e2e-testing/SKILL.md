# AWT — AI-Powered E2E Testing (Beta)

> `npx skills add ksgisang/awt-skill --skill awt -g`

AWT gives AI coding tools the ability to see and interact with web applications through a real browser. Your AI designs YAML test scenarios; AWT executes them with Playwright.

## When to Use
- You need AI-assisted end-to-end testing through a real browser with declarative YAML scenarios.
- The test flow depends on visual matching, OCR, or platform auto-detection instead of stable DOM selectors.
- You want an E2E toolchain that can both execute tests and explain failures for AI coding workflows.

## What works now
- YAML scenarios → Playwright with human-like interaction
- Visual matching: OpenCV template + OCR (no CSS selectors needed)
- Platform auto-detection: Flutter, React, Next.js, Vue, Angular, Svelte
- Structured failure diagnosis with investigation checklists
- Learning DB: failure→fix patterns in SQLite
- 5 AI providers: Claude, OpenAI, Gemini, DeepSeek, Ollama
- Skill Mode: no extra AI API key needed

## Limitations
- Use this skill only when the task clearly matches the scope described above.
- Do not treat the output as a substitute for environment-specific validation, testing, or expert review.
- Stop and ask for clarification if required inputs, permissions, safety boundaries, or success criteria are missing.
