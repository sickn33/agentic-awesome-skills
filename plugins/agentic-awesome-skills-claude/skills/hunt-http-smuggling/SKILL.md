> **⚠️ AUTHORIZED USE ONLY**
> This skill is for educational purposes or authorized security assessments only.
> You must have explicit, written permission from the system owner before using this tool.
> Misuse of this tool is illegal and strictly prohibited.

> **Mandatory confirmation gate**
> Before running any command that probes, exploits, changes, persists on, extracts data from, or attempts credential access against a target:
> 1. Ask the user to state the exact target URL, IP, account, or resource.
> 2. Ask the user to confirm written authorization and the permitted scope.
> 3. Show the exact command(s) and explain their expected effect.
> 4. Wait for explicit confirmation in the current conversation.
>
> Without that confirmation, remain read-only and provide defensive guidance only. Prefer a sandbox, disposable VM, or controlled lab.

##  HTTP REQUEST SMUGGLING
> Parser disagreement between hops requires controlled validation; bounty amounts and duplicate rates are not established here.

### CL.TE (Content-Length front, Transfer-Encoding back)
```http
POST / HTTP/1.1
Content-Length: 13
Transfer-Encoding: chunked

0

SMUGGLED
```

### Detection
```
1. Burp extension: HTTP Request Smuggler
2. Right-click request → Extensions → HTTP Request Smuggler → Smuggle probe
3. Manual timing: CL.TE probe + ~10s delay = backend waiting for rest of body
```

### Impact Chain
```
Poison next request → access admin as victim
Steal credentials → capture victim's session
Cache poisoning → stored XSS at scale
```

## Topology and controlled validation

Do not infer safety or vulnerability from a Server header or broad product/version
matrix. Identify the actual client/front-end/origin protocol, exact release,
configuration, connection reuse and vendor advisory. Header banners may be hidden
or forged. HTTP/2 downgrading can introduce inconsistencies, but HTTP/2 alone does
not prove a flaw. Use a tool that supports the specific wire protocol and disable
automatic content-length rewriting only in an isolated authorized lab.

Timing changes can result from network jitter or rejection; compare repeated
baseline/control probes within the permitted request budget, then demonstrate
cross-request interference with two accounts and connections you control. Never
harvest real users' headers or poison a shared production cache. Use a harmless
unique marker, isolated cache key, stop condition and cleanup plan. If third-party
traffic could be affected, stop and reproduce in the owner's isolated environment.
The inline HTTP fragment is a byte-sensitive teaching sketch, not a ready probe:
include Host, explicit CRLF and correct encoded lengths for the chosen transport.

## Related Skills & Chains

- **`hunt-cache-poison`** — Smuggling + cache is the canonical critical chain; one smuggled request becomes the cached response for every subsequent victim. Chain primitive: CL.TE smuggle a request whose response body contains attacker HTML/JS → front-end cache stores it under a popular URL (`/`, `/login`) → de-sync poisoning where the smuggled request becomes the cached response for the next N victims, persisting for the cache TTL.
- **`hunt-auth-bypass`** — Smuggling reaches internal-only routes that the front-end WAF/auth-proxy filters out. Chain primitive: smuggle `GET /admin/users HTTP/1.1` past the front-end ACL that blocks external `/admin/*` → backend processes the smuggled request as if from a trusted internal source → bypass front-end auth by smuggling internal-routed request → admin data in the response queue.
- **`hunt-idor`** — Smuggling attaches the NEXT user's session cookies to an attacker-controlled request path. Chain primitive: smuggle `GET /api/me HTTP/1.1` with no cookies → backend pairs it with the next legitimate user's incoming connection cookies → victim's session cookie attached to attacker's smuggled request → attacker reads the response containing victim's PII/tokens.
- **`hunt-xss`** — Smuggling injects XSS payloads into the response stream of the next victim without ever appearing in a URL parameter. Chain primitive: smuggled request body contains reflected payload that the backend renders into the next response in the queue → next visitor to `/` receives attacker HTML inline → reflected XSS at every visitor without any URL parameter visible to them or to logs.
- **`security-arsenal`** — Reach for the smuggling payload bank (CL.TE / TE.CL / TE.TE obfuscations, H2.CL downgrade probes, h2csmuggler one-liners, Burp HTTP Request Smuggler extension config) and the time-delay confirmation template before manual hex-editing.
- **`triage-validation`** — Run the Pre-Severity Gate before claiming Critical: the smuggled-request effect MUST land on a request issued by a different client/session, not merely a timing anomaly; use a separate controlled test client, never an unsuspecting user. A timing delta in your own browser alone is parser disagreement, not exploitable smuggling.

## When to Use

- You have explicit, written authorization to assess the target in scope, and the task matches this skill's vulnerability class or technique within a bug-bounty or penetration-test engagement.
- You need the recon, exploitation, or validation workflow described below — executed strictly inside the approved scope.

## Limitations

- Authorized scope only: the confirmation gate above is mandatory before any probing, exploitation, or credential-access command.
- Docs-only import: upstream helper scripts, commands, engine, and research assets are not bundled; reinstall tooling from the source repo when needed.
- Validate every finding (see `triage-validation`) before reporting; report via `report-writing`. Prefer a sandbox, disposable VM, or controlled lab.

### Example

```bash
# Read-only first step; confirm scope before anything active.
cat scope.txt  # target list from the authorized engagement brief
```
