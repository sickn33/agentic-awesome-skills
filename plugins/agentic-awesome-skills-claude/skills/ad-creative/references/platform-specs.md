## Google Ads

### Responsive Search Ads (RSAs)

| Element | Character Limit | Required | Notes |
|---------|----------------|----------|-------|
| Headline | 30 chars | 3 minimum, 15 max | Up to 3 may be shown together |
| Description | 90 chars | 2 minimum, 4 max | Up to 2 may be shown together |
| Display path 1 | 15 chars | Optional | Appears after domain in URL |
| Display path 2 | 15 chars | Optional | Appears after path 1 |
| Final URL | Verify current URL constraints | Required | Landing page URL |

**Combination rules:**
- Google selects up to 3 headlines and 2 descriptions to show
- Headlines appear separated by " | " or stacked
- Any headline can appear in any position unless pinned
- Pinning reduces Google's ability to optimize — use sparingly

**Pinning strategy:**
- Pin your brand name to position 1 if brand guidelines require it
- If text must always show, use supported mandatory positions; headline 3 and description 2 are not guaranteed to display
- Leave most headlines unpinned for machine learning

**Headline mix recommendation (15 headlines):**
- 3-4 keyword-focused (match search intent)
- 3-4 benefit-focused (what they get)
- 2-3 social proof (numbers, awards, customers)
- 2-3 CTA-focused (action to take)
- 1-2 differentiators (why you over competitors)
- 1 brand name headline

**Description mix recommendation (4 descriptions):**
- 1 benefit + proof point
- 1 feature + outcome
- 1 social proof + CTA
- 1 urgency/offer + CTA (if applicable)

## Meta Ads (Facebook & Instagram)

### Single Image / Video / Carousel

| Element | Recommended | Maximum | Notes |
|---------|-------------|---------|-------|

- **Feed**: All elements show; primary text most visible
- **Stories/Reels**: Primary text overlaid; keep under 72 chars
- **Right column**: Only headline visible; skip description
- **Audience Network**: Varies by publisher

**Best practices:**
- Front-load the hook in primary text (first 125 chars)
- Use line breaks for readability in longer primary text
- Emojis: test, but don't overuse — 1-2 per ad max
- Test questions in primary text as a hypothesis, not a guaranteed engagement gain
- Headline should be a clear CTA or value statement

**TikTok-specific guidelines:**

- Threads can work for consideration-stage content

---

## Character Counting Tips

- **Spaces count** as characters on all platforms
- **Emojis** and combined Unicode sequences use platform-specific counting; JavaScript/Python length alone may differ
- **Special characters** follow platform-specific counting, including double-width rules
- **URLs** may have platform-specific transformed/weighted lengths
- **Dynamic keyword insertion** (`{KeyWord:default}`) can exceed limits — set safe defaults
- Always verify in the platform's ad preview before launching

## Multi-Platform Creative Adaptation

When creating for multiple platforms simultaneously, start with the most restrictive format:

1. **Google Search headlines** (30 chars) — forces the tightest messaging
2. **Expand to Meta headlines** (40 chars) — add a word or two
3. **Expand to LinkedIn intro text** (150 chars) — add context and proof
4. **Expand to Meta primary text** (125+ chars) — full hook and value prop

This cascading approach ensures your core message works everywhere, then gets enriched for platforms that allow more space.
