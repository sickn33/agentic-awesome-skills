# SEO: Universal SEO Analysis Skill

Comprehensive SEO analysis across all industries (SaaS, local services,
e-commerce, publishers, agencies). Orchestrates 12 specialized sub-skills and 7 subagents
(+ optional extension sub-skills like seo-dataforseo).

## When to Use
- Use when the user asks for a full SEO audit or broad SEO strategy.
- Use as the umbrella entry point when multiple SEO dimensions are in scope.
- Use when the task spans technical SEO, content, schema, sitemaps, and AI search readiness together.

## Quick Reference

| `/seo audit <url>` | Full website audit with parallel subagent delegation |
| `/seo page <url>` | Deep single-page analysis |
| `/seo sitemap <url or generate>` | Analyze or generate XML sitemaps |
| `/seo schema <url>` | Detect, validate, and generate Schema.org markup |
| `/seo images <url>` | Image optimization analysis |
| `/seo technical <url>` | Technical SEO audit (9 categories) |
| `/seo content <url>` | E-E-A-T and content quality analysis |
| `/seo geo <url>` | AI Overviews / Generative Engine Optimization |
| `/seo plan <business-type>` | Strategic SEO planning |
| `/seo programmatic [url\|plan]` | Programmatic SEO analysis and planning |

| `/seo image-gen [use-case] <description>` | AI image generation for SEO assets (extension) |

## Orchestration Logic

When the user invokes `/seo audit`, delegate to subagents in parallel:
1. Detect business type (SaaS, local, ecommerce, publisher, agency, other)
2. Spawn subagents: seo-technical, seo-content, seo-schema, seo-sitemap, seo-performance, seo-visual, seo-geo
3. Collect results and generate unified report with SEO Health Score (0-100)
4. Create prioritized action plan (Critical -> High -> Medium -> Low)

For individual commands, load the relevant sub-skill directly.

## Industry Detection

Detect business type from homepage signals:
- **SaaS**: pricing page, /features, /integrations, /docs, "free trial", "sign up"
- **Local Service**: phone number, address, service area, "serving [city]", Google Maps embed
- **E-commerce**: /products, /collections, /cart, "add to cart", product schema
- **Publisher**: /blog, /articles, /topics, article schema, author pages, publication dates
- **Agency**: /case-studies, /portfolio, /industries, "our work", client logos

## Quality Gates

Read `references/quality-gates.md` for thin content thresholds per page type.
Hard rules:
- WARNING at 30+ location pages (enforce 60%+ unique content)
- HARD STOP at 50+ location pages (require user justification)
- Never recommend HowTo schema (deprecated Sept 2023)
- FAQ schema for Google rich results: only government and healthcare sites (Aug 2023 restriction); existing FAQPage on commercial sites -> flag Info priority (not Critical), noting AI/LLM citation benefit; adding new FAQPage -> not recommended for Google benefit
- All Core Web Vitals references use INP, never FID

## Reference Files

Load these on-demand as needed (do NOT load all at startup):
- `references/cwv-thresholds.md`: Current Core Web Vitals thresholds and measurement details
- `references/schema-types.md`: All supported schema types with deprecation status
- `references/eeat-framework.md`: E-E-A-T evaluation criteria (Sept 2025 QRG update)
- `references/quality-gates.md`: Content length minimums, uniqueness thresholds

## Scoring Methodology

### SEO Health Score (0-100)
Weighted aggregate of all categories:

| Category | Weight |
|----------|--------|
| Technical SEO | 22% |
| Content Quality | 23% |
| On-Page SEO | 20% |
| Schema / Structured Data | 10% |
| Performance (CWV) | 10% |
| AI Search Readiness | 10% |
| Images | 5% |

### Priority Levels
- **Critical**: Blocks indexing or causes penalties (immediate fix required)
- **High**: Significantly impacts rankings (fix within 1 week)
- **Medium**: Optimization opportunity (fix within 1 month)
- **Low**: Nice to have (backlog)

## Error Handling

| Scenario | Action |
|----------|--------|
| Unrecognized command | List available commands from the Quick Reference table. Suggest the closest matching command. |
| URL unreachable | Report the error and suggest the user verify the URL. Do not attempt to guess site content. |
| Sub-skill fails during audit | Report partial results from successful sub-skills. Clearly note which sub-skill failed and why. Suggest re-running the failed sub-skill individually. |
| Ambiguous business type detection | Present the top two detected types with supporting signals. Ask the user to confirm before proceeding with industry-specific recommendations. |

## Limitations
- Use this skill only when the task clearly matches the scope described above.
- Do not treat the output as a substitute for environment-specific validation, testing, or expert review.
- Stop and ask for clarification if required inputs, permissions, safety boundaries, or success criteria are missing.
