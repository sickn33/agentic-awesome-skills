# Agent Memory Skill

This skill provides a persistent, searchable memory bank that automatically syncs with project documentation. It runs as an MCP server to allow reading/writing/searching of long-term memories.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js (v18+)

## Setup

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   Clone the `agentMemory` project into your agent's workspace or a parallel directory:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/webzler/agentMemory.git .agent/skills/agent-memory
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:

   ```bash
   cd .agent/skills/agent-memory
   npm install
   npm run compile
   ```

3. **Start the MCP Server**:
   Use the helper script to activate the memory bank for your current project:

   ```bash
   npm run start-server <project_id> <absolute_path_to_target_workspace>
   ```

   _Example for current directory:_

   ```bash
   npm run start-server my-project $(pwd)
   ```

## Capabilities (MCP Tools)

### `memory_search`

Search for memories by query, type, or tags.

- **Args**: `query` (string), `type?` (string), `tags?` (string[])
- **Usage**: "Find all authentication patterns" -> `memory_search({ query: "authentication", type: "pattern" })`

### `memory_write`

Record new knowledge or decisions.

- **Args**: `key` (string), `type` (string), `content` (string), `tags?` (string[])
- **Usage**: "Save this architecture decision" -> `memory_write({ key: "auth-v1", type: "decision", content: "..." })`

### `memory_read`

Retrieve specific memory content by key.

- **Args**: `key` (string)
- **Usage**: "Get the auth design" -> `memory_read({ key: "auth-v1" })`

### `memory_stats`

View analytics on memory usage.

- **Usage**: "Show memory statistics" -> `memory_stats({})`

## Dashboard

This skill includes a standalone dashboard to visualize memory usage.

```bash
npm run start-dashboard <absolute_path_to_target_workspace>
```
