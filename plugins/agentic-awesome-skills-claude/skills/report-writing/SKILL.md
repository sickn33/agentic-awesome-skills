# REPORT WRITING

Impact-first. Human tone. No theoretical language. Triagers are people.

---

## THE MOST IMPORTANT RULE

> **Never use "could potentially" or "could be used to" or "may allow".**
> Either it does the thing or it doesn't. If you haven't proved it, don't claim it.

```
BAD:  "This vulnerability could potentially allow an attacker to access user data."
GOOD: "An attacker can access any user's order history by changing the user_id
       parameter to the target user's ID. I confirmed this using two test accounts:
       attacker@test.com (ID 123) successfully retrieved victim@test.com (ID 456)
       orders, including their shipping address and payment method last 4 digits."
```

---

## TITLE FORMULA

```
[Bug Class] in [Exact Endpoint/Feature] allows [attacker role] to [impact] [victim scope]
```

**Good titles (specific, impact-first):**
```
IDOR in /api/v2/invoices/{id} allows authenticated user to read any customer's invoice data
Missing auth on POST /api/admin/users allows unauthenticated attacker to create admin accounts
Stored XSS in profile bio field executes in admin panel — allows privilege escalation
SSRF via image import URL parameter reaches AWS EC2 metadata service
Race condition in coupon redemption allows same code to be used unlimited times
```

**Bad titles (vague, useless to triager):**
```
IDOR vulnerability found
Broken access control
XSS in user input
Security issue in API
Unauthorized access to user data
```

## HACKERONE REPORT TEMPLATE

```markdown
## Summary

[One paragraph: what the bug is, where it is, what an attacker can do. Be specific.
Include: endpoint, method, parameter, data exposed, required access level.]

Example: "The `/api/users/{user_id}/orders` endpoint does not verify that the
authenticated user owns the requested user_id. An attacker can enumerate any
user's order history, including PII (email, address, phone) and purchase history,
by incrementing the user_id parameter. No privileges beyond a standard free
account are required."

## Vulnerability Details

**Vulnerability Type:** IDOR / Broken Object Level Authorization
**CVSS 3.1 Score:** 6.5 (Medium) — AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N
**Affected Endpoint:** GET /api/users/{user_id}/orders

## Steps to Reproduce

**Environment:**
- Attacker account: attacker@test.com, user_id = 123
- Victim account: victim@test.com, user_id = 456
- Target: https://target.com

**Steps:**

1. Log in as attacker@test.com, obtain Bearer token

2. Send the following request:

```
GET /api/users/456/orders HTTP/1.1
Host: target.com
Authorization: Bearer ATTACKER_TOKEN_HERE
```

3. Observe response:

```json
{
  "orders": [
    {"id": 789, "items": [...], "email": "victim@test.com", "address": "123 Main St..."}
  ]
}
```

The response contains victim's full order history and PII despite being requested
by a different user.

## Impact

An authenticated attacker can enumerate all user orders by iterating user_id values.
This exposes: full name, email, shipping address, purchase history, and payment
method (last 4). With ~100K users, this represents a mass PII breach affecting
all registered users. Exploitation requires only a free account and takes minutes
with a simple loop.

## Recommended Fix

Add server-side ownership verification:
```python
if order.user_id != current_user.id:
    raise Forbidden()
```

## Supporting Materials

[Screenshot showing attacker's session returning victim's order data]
[Video walkthrough if available]

## BUGCROWD REPORT TEMPLATE

```markdown
# [IDOR] User order history accessible without authorization via /api/users/{id}/orders

**VRT Category:** Broken Access Control > IDOR > P2

## Description

[Same impact-first paragraph as HackerOne summary]

## Steps to Reproduce

[Same structured steps — exact HTTP requests, exact responses]

## Proof of Concept

[Screenshot/video showing the actual impact]

## Expected vs Actual Behavior

**Expected:** 403 Forbidden when user_id does not match authenticated user
**Actual:** 200 OK with victim's full order data

## Severity Justification

P2 (High) — Direct read access to other users' PII. Affects all user accounts.
No user interaction required. Exploitable by any authenticated user.
Automated enumeration could exfil all [N] user records in minutes.

## Remediation

Add ownership verification: `if order.user_id != current_user.id: raise 403`
```

## INTIGRITI REPORT TEMPLATE

```markdown
# [Bug Class]: [Exact Impact] in [Endpoint/Feature]

## Description

[Impact-first paragraph. Start with what an attacker can do, not with how you found it.
Include: endpoint, method, parameter, data exposed, required privileges.]

## Steps to Reproduce

**Environment:**
- Attacker: email=attacker@test.com (standard account, no special role)
- Victim: email=victim@test.com
- Tested: [date]

**Reproduction steps:**

1. [Login as attacker / visit URL / send request]

2. Send the following HTTP request:

\```http
METHOD /endpoint HTTP/1.1
Host: target.com
Authorization: Bearer ATTACKER_TOKEN
Content-Type: application/json

{"param": "victim_id_here"}
\```

3. Observe response contains victim's private data:

\```json
{"email": "victim@test.com", "address": "123 Main St", ...}
\```

## Impact

[Specific, quantified impact. What data, how many users, what can attacker do.]

CVSS 3.1 Score: X.X ([Severity]) — AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N

## Remediation

[1-3 sentence concrete fix. Include code if helpful.]

## Attachments

[Screenshot or Loom video showing the impact — Intigriti triagers prefer video for complex bugs]
```

**Intigriti-specific notes:**
- Title format: `[Bug Class]: [One-line impact]` (no formula required, but keep it specific)
- Severity is set by you: Critical/High/Medium/Low/Exceptional
- CVSS 3.1 is standard (CVSS 4.0 also accepted on newer programs)
- PoC video is valued much more than screenshot alone — record with Loom
- Safe harbor: Intigriti enforces it, be comfortable going slightly aggressive with testing

## CVSS 3.1 QUICK SCORING

### Formula
```
CVSS = f(AV, AC, PR, UI, S, C, I, A)
```

### Metric Quick Picks

| Metric | Value | Weight | When |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Attack Vector (AV)** | Network | +0.85 | Via internet |
| | Local | +0.55 | Local access needed |
| **Attack Complexity (AC)** | Low | +0.77 | Repeatable |
| | High | +0.44 | Race/timing needed |
| **Privileges Required (PR)** | None | +0.85 | No login |
| | Low | +0.62 | Regular user account |
| | High | +0.27 | Admin account |
| **User Interaction (UI)** | None | +0.85 | No victim action |
| | Required | +0.62 | Victim must click |
| **Scope (S)** | Changed | higher | Affects browser/OS/other |
| | Unchanged | lower | Stays in app |
| **Confidentiality (C)** | High | +0.56 | All data exposed |
| | Low | +0.22 | Limited data |
| **Integrity (I)** | High | +0.56 | Can modify any data |
| **Availability (A)** | High | +0.56 | Crashes service |

### Typical Scores by Bug Class

| Bug | Typical CVSS | Severity |
|---|---|---|
| IDOR (read PII) | 6.5 | Medium |
| IDOR (write/delete) | 7.5 | High |
| Auth bypass → admin | 9.8 | Critical |
| Stored XSS (any user) | 5.4–8.8 | Med–High |
| SQLi (data exfil) | 8.6 | High |
| SSRF (cloud metadata) | 9.1 | Critical |
| Race condition (double spend) | 7.5 | High |
| GraphQL auth bypass | 8.7 | High |
| JWT none algorithm | 9.1 | Critical |

---

## SEVERITY DECISION GUIDE

### Critical (P1)
- Full account takeover of any user without interaction
- Remote code execution
- SQLi with ability to dump/modify entire DB
- Auth bypass to admin panel
- SSRF to cloud metadata → IAM credentials exfil

### High (P2)
- Mass PII exposure (email, phone, SSN, payment data)
- Privilege escalation from user to admin
- SSRF reaching internal services (data returned)
- Stored XSS executing for all users of sensitive feature
- Payment bypass / financial loss without limit

### Medium (P3)
- IDOR on specific user's non-critical data
- XSS on low-sensitivity page requiring victim interaction
- CSRF on important but non-critical action
- Rate limit bypass on OTP (with effort demonstrated)

### Low (P4)
- Information disclosure (non-sensitive, no PII)
- Clickjacking on sensitive action WITH working PoC
- CORS on limited data

---

## SEVERITY SELF-ASSESSMENT

Each YES raises severity:
```
1. Exposes PII / health / financial data of other users?        → +1 severity
2. Allows account takeover or privilege escalation?             → +2 severity
3. Requires ZERO user interaction from victim?                  → +1 severity
4. Affects ALL users (not specific condition)?                  → +1 severity
5. Remotely exploitable with no internal network access?        → baseline for High+
```

## DOWNGRADE COUNTERS

| Program Says | Counter With |
|---|---|
| "Requires authentication" | "Attacker needs only a free account — no special role or permission" |
| "Limited impact" | "Affects [N] users / exposes [PII type] / $[amount] at risk" |
| "Already known" | "Show me the report number — I searched hacktivity and found none" |
| "By design" | "Show me the documentation stating this is intended behavior" |
| "Low CVSS" | "CVSS doesn't capture business impact — attacker can extract [X] in [Y] minutes" |
| "Not exploitable" | "Here is the exact response showing victim's data returned to attacker session" |

- You need this skill's process guidance (reporting format, evidence handling, detection notes, or scope triage) during an authorized engagement.
- No active probing is involved in this step.

## Limitations

- Process guidance only; it does not authorize probing or exploitation — those steps need their own authorized skill and confirmation gate.
- Docs-only import: upstream templates, commands, and research assets are not bundled.
