# GEO Schema & Structured Data

## Purpose

Structured data is the primary machine-readable signal that tells AI systems what an entity IS, what it does, and how it connects to other entities. While schema markup has traditionally been about earning Google rich results, its role in GEO is fundamentally different: **structured data is how AI models understand and trust your entity**. A complete entity graph in structured data dramatically increases citation probability across all AI search platforms.

## How to Use This Skill

1. Fetch the target page HTML using `fetch_page.py` (see note below)
2. Detect all existing structured data (JSON-LD, Microdata, RDFa)
3. Validate detected schemas against Schema.org specifications
4. Identify missing recommended schemas based on business type
5. Generate ready-to-use JSON-LD code blocks
6. Output GEO-SCHEMA-REPORT.md

---

## Step 1: Detection

**IMPORTANT:** WebFetch converts HTML to markdown and strips `<head>` content, which removes JSON-LD blocks. Use `fetch_page.py` instead:
```bash
python3 ~/.claude/skills/geo/scripts/fetch_page.py <url> page
```
The output includes a `structured_data` array with all parsed JSON-LD blocks from the page.

### Scan for JSON-LD
Look for `<script type="application/ld+json">` blocks in the HTML. Parse each block as JSON. A page may contain multiple JSON-LD blocks — collect all of them.

### Scan for Microdata
Look for elements with `itemscope`, `itemtype`, and `itemprop` attributes. Map the hierarchy of nested items. Note: Microdata is harder for AI crawlers to parse than JSON-LD. Flag a recommendation to migrate to JSON-LD if Microdata is the only format found.

### Scan for RDFa
Look for elements with `typeof`, `property`, and `vocab` attributes. Similar to Microdata — recommend migration to JSON-LD.

### Priority Order
JSON-LD is the **strongly recommended format** for GEO. Google, Bing, and AI platforms all process JSON-LD most reliably. If the site uses Microdata or RDFa exclusively, flag this as a high-priority migration.

---

## Step 2: Validation

For each detected schema block, validate:

1. **Valid JSON**: Is the JSON-LD syntactically valid? Check for trailing commas, unquoted keys, malformed strings.
2. **Valid @type**: Does the `@type` match a recognized Schema.org type? Check against https://schema.org/docs/full.html.
3. **Required Properties**: Does the schema include all required properties for its type? (See per-type requirements below.)
4. **Recommended Properties**: Does the schema include recommended properties that increase AI discoverability?
5. **sameAs Links**: Does the schema include `sameAs` properties linking to other platform presences?
6. **URL Validity**: Do all URLs in the schema resolve (not 404)?
7. **Nesting**: Is the schema properly nested (e.g., author inside Article, address inside Organization)?
8. **Rendering Method**: Is the JSON-LD in the server-rendered HTML or injected via JavaScript? Per Google's December 2025 guidance, **JavaScript-injected structured data may face delayed processing**. Flag any schema that requires JS execution.

## Step 3: Schema Types for GEO

### Organization (CRITICAL — every business site)
Essential for entity recognition across all AI platforms. This is how AI models identify WHAT the business is.

**Required properties:**
- `@type`: "Organization" (or subtype: Corporation, LocalBusiness, etc.)
- `name`: Official business name
- `url`: Official website URL
- `logo`: URL to logo image (ImageObject preferred)

**Recommended properties for GEO:**
- `sameAs`: Array of ALL platform URLs (see sameAs strategy below)
- `description`: 1-2 sentence description of the organization
- `foundingDate`: ISO 8601 date
- `founder`: Person schema
- `address`: PostalAddress schema
- `contactPoint`: ContactPoint with telephone, email, contactType
- `areaServed`: Geographic area
- `numberOfEmployees`: QuantitativeValue
- `industry`: Text or DefinedTerm
- `award`: Array of awards received
- `knowsAbout`: Array of topics the organization is expert in (strong GEO signal)

### LocalBusiness (for businesses with physical locations)
Extends Organization. Critical for local AI search results and Google Gemini.

**Additional required properties:**
- `address`: Full PostalAddress
- `telephone`: Phone number
- `openingHoursSpecification`: Operating hours

**Recommended for GEO:**
- `geo`: GeoCoordinates (latitude, longitude)
- `priceRange`: Price indicator
- `aggregateRating`: AggregateRating schema
- `review`: Array of Review schemas
- `hasMap`: URL to Google Maps

### Article + Author (CRITICAL for publishers)
The Author schema is one of the strongest E-E-A-T signals for AI platforms.

**Article required:**
- `@type`: "Article" (or NewsArticle, BlogPosting, TechArticle)
- `headline`: Article title
- `datePublished`: ISO 8601
- `dateModified`: ISO 8601 (critical for freshness signals)
- `author`: Person or Organization schema
- `publisher`: Organization schema with logo
- `image`: Representative image

**Author (Person) required for GEO:**
- `name`: Full name
- `url`: Author page URL on the site
- `sameAs`: LinkedIn, Twitter, personal site, Google Scholar, ORCID
- `jobTitle`: Professional title
- `worksFor`: Organization schema
- `knowsAbout`: Array of expertise areas
- `alumniOf`: Educational institutions
- `award`: Professional awards

### Product (for e-commerce)
**Required:**
- `name`, `description`, `image`
- `offers`: Offer with price, priceCurrency, availability
- `brand`: Brand schema
- `sku` or `gtin`/`mpn`

**Recommended for GEO:**
- `aggregateRating`: AggregateRating
- `review`: Array of individual reviews
- `category`: Product category
- `material`, `weight`, `width`, `height` (where applicable)

### FAQPage
**Status as of 2024**: Google restricts FAQ rich results to government and health sites. However, the FAQPage schema still serves GEO purposes — AI platforms parse FAQ structured data for question-answer extraction. Implement it for AI readability even though rich results may not appear.

**Structure:**
- `@type`: "FAQPage"
- `mainEntity`: Array of Question schemas, each with `acceptedAnswer` containing an Answer schema

### SoftwareApplication (for SaaS)
**Required:**
- `name`, `description`
- `applicationCategory`: e.g., "BusinessApplication"
- `operatingSystem`: Supported platforms
- `offers`: Pricing

**Recommended for GEO:**
- `aggregateRating`: User ratings
- `featureList`: Array of features (strong citation signal)
- `screenshot`: Screenshots
- `softwareVersion`: Current version
- `releaseNotes`: Link to changelog

### WebSite + SearchAction (for sitelinks search box)
**Structure:**
```json
{
  "@type": "WebSite",
  "name": "Site Name",
  "url": "https://example.com",
  "potentialAction": {
    "@type": "SearchAction",
    "target": {
      "@type": "EntryPoint",
      "urlTemplate": "https://example.com/search?q={search_term_string}"
    },
    "query-input": "required name=search_term_string"
  }
}
```

### Person (standalone — for personal brands, authors, thought leaders)
Use as a standalone schema on About/Bio pages. This builds the entity graph for individual expertise.

**Required:** `name`, `url`
**Recommended for GEO:** `sameAs`, `jobTitle`, `worksFor`, `knowsAbout`, `alumniOf`, `award`, `description`, `image`

### speakable Property (for voice/AI assistants)
The `speakable` property marks specific sections of content as particularly suitable for voice and AI assistant consumption. Add to Article or WebPage schemas.

```json
{
  "@type": "Article",
  "speakable": {
    "@type": "SpeakableSpecification",
    "cssSelector": [".article-summary", ".key-takeaway"]
  }
}
```
This signals to AI assistants which passages are the best candidates for citation or reading aloud.

## Step 4: Deprecated/Changed Schemas to Flag

| Schema | Status | Note |
|---|---|---|
| HowTo | Rich results deprecated Aug 2023 | Still useful for AI parsing, but do not promise rich results |
| FAQPage | Restricted to govt/health Aug 2023 | Still useful for AI parsing (see above) |
| SpecialAnnouncement | Deprecated 2023 | Was for COVID; remove if still present |
| CourseInfo | Replaced by Course updates 2024 | Use updated Course schema properties |
| VideoObject `contentUrl` | Changed behavior 2024 | Must point to actual video file, not page URL |
| Review snippet | Stricter enforcement 2024 | Self-serving reviews on product pages may not display |

Flag any deprecated schemas found and recommend replacements.

---

## Step 5: sameAs Strategy (CRITICAL for Entity Recognition)

The `sameAs` property is the single most important structured data property for GEO. It tells AI systems: "This entity on my website is the SAME entity as these profiles elsewhere." This creates the entity graph that AI platforms use to verify, trust, and cite sources.

### Recommended sameAs Links (in priority order)

1. **Wikipedia article** — highest authority entity link
2. **Wikidata item** — machine-readable entity identifier (e.g., `https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q12345`)
3. **LinkedIn** — company page or personal profile
4. **YouTube** — channel URL
5. **Twitter/X** — profile URL
6. **Facebook** — page URL
7. **Crunchbase** — company profile (for startups/tech)
8. **GitHub** — organization or personal profile (for tech)
9. **Google Scholar** — author profile (for researchers/academics)
10. **ORCID** — researcher identifier (for academics)
11. **Instagram** — profile URL
12. **Apple App Store / Google Play** — app listings (for software)
13. **BBB** — Better Business Bureau listing (for US businesses)
14. **Industry directories** — relevant vertical directories

### sameAs Audit Process
1. Collect all known web presences for the entity
2. Check that each URL resolves (not 404 or redirected)
3. Verify the Organization/Person schema includes ALL of them
4. Check that the information on each platform is consistent (name, description, founding date, etc.)
5. Flag any platforms where the entity should have a presence but does not

---

## Step 6: JSON-LD Generation

Based on the detected business type, generate ready-to-paste JSON-LD blocks. Always generate:

1. **Organization or Person** (depending on entity type) — always
2. **WebSite with SearchAction** — always for the homepage
3. **Business-type-specific** — Article for publishers, Product for e-commerce, LocalBusiness for local, SoftwareApplication for SaaS
4. **BreadcrumbList** — for any page deeper than homepage

### Generation Rules
- Use the `@graph` pattern to include multiple schemas in one JSON-LD block
- All URLs must be absolute (not relative)
- Include `@id` properties for cross-referencing between schemas
- Use ISO 8601 for all dates
- Include `speakable` on Article schemas with CSS selectors pointing to key content sections
- Place JSON-LD in `<head>` section — NOT injected via JavaScript

## When to Use

- You need a Generative Engine Optimization task for a website: audit, citability, crawlers, schema, llms.txt, content, platform tuning, or client reporting.
- Run read-only analysis first; propose site changes before making any.

## Limitations

- Audits are read-only analysis; never publish, deploy, or modify the target site without explicit approval.
- Scores and citation likelihoods are heuristics, not guarantees from AI search platforms.
- Docs-only import: upstream scripts, agents, hooks, and schema templates are not bundled.

### Example

```bash
curl -s https://example.com/robots.txt
curl -s https://example.com/llms.txt
```
